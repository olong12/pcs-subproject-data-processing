              Knox, Longville, Washington)February 23, 1999An act to amend Section 6025 of the Penal Code, relating to the Board of Corrections.LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 652, as amended, Nakano.
                          Board of Corrections.Under existing law, the Board of Corrections is composed of 13 members, 3 of whom are ex officio members and 10 of whom are appointed by the Governor.  The 10 appointed members are required to include persons from specified backgrounds.This bill would expand the board to 15 17 members by revising the existing county supervisor or county administrative officer appointment provision to specify that this officer be from a county with a population over 200,000 and to include the appointment of this class of officer from a county with a population under 200,000.  The bill would further expand the board by including among the appointed members a rank and file deputy sheriff, a rank and file correctional officer or correctional assistant, each with a minimum of 5 years of experience working in a custody assignment and, a rank and file deputy probation officer with a minimum of 5 years of experience working in a juvenile hall, camp, or ranch, and an administrator of a community-based youth service program, thereby increasing the number of appointed members to 12 14.Existing law requires one of the appointments to be a rank and file representative of a local corrections facility at a level of first line supervisor or below, with a minimum of 5 years experience.This bill would delete the requirement that the above-described representative be included in the gubernatorial appointments to the board.Digest Key
