                          Minors:  special education.Existing law provides that the juvenile court shall have jurisdiction in the case of a minor who has been abused or neglected, and may adjudge that minor to be a dependent child of the court.  Existing law also provides that the juvenile court shall have jurisdiction in the case of a person who is alleged to have violated any law or ordinance when he or she was under 18 years of age and may adjudge that person to be a ward of the court.These provisions require that various services be provided to these minors, including care, treatment, and guidance.  These provisions also require that the court and local employees, including probation officers and social workers, and court-appointed special advocates, monitor, among other things, the placement of these minors and ensure that they receive services to which they are entitled.Existing law requires that children with special educational needs, as defined, and persons with disabilities, as described, are entitled to various educational services and accommodations, as specified.This bill would revise the provisions of the juvenile court law to require the court, court-appointed special advocates, probation officers, and social workers, as applicable, to take specified actions to ensure that these children receive any educational and related services and any accommodations for the disabled, as applicable, to which they are entitled under state and federal law, as specified.By imposing additional duties on local employees, the bill would create a state-mandated local program.The bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 202 of the Welfare and Institutions Code made by AB 575, which would become operative only if both bills are enacted and this bill is enacted after AB 575.The bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 358.1 of the Welfare and Institutions Code contained in AB 247, which would become operative only if both bills are enacted and this bill is enacted after AB 247.This bill would provide that certain changes to Section 706.5 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, would become operative only if this bill and AB 575 are enacted.The bill would incorporate additional changes to Sections 361, 361.5, and 366.21 of the Welfare and Institutions Code made by AB 645, AB 740, and SB 1226 to take effect if those bills are enacted and this bill is enacted last.
   The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement, including the creation of a State Mandates Claims Fund to pay the costs of mandates that do not exceed $1,000,000 statewide and other procedures for claims whose statewide costs exceed $1,000,000.This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.Digest KeyBill TextThe people of the State of California do enact as follows:SECTION 1. Section 19 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:19. It is the purpose of this code, in establishing programs and services which are designed to provide protection, support or care of children, to provide protective services to the fullest extent deemed necessary by the juvenile court, probation department or other public agencies designated by the board of supervisors to perform the duties prescribed by this code to insure that the educational rights, including the right to receive special education and related services if the child has exceptional needs as described in Part 30 (commencing with Section 56000) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Education Code, and the right to receive accommodations if the child has disabilities as described in Chapter 16 of Title 29 of the United States Code Annotated, or other rights or physical, mental or moral welfare of children are not violated or threatened by their present circumstances or environment.  These essential services may be provided irrespective of whether the child or the family of the child is otherwise known to the responsible local agency.SEC. 2. Section 102 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:102. (a) Each CASA program shall, if feasible, be staffed by a minimum of one paid administrator.  The staff shall be directly accountable to the presiding juvenile court judge and the CASA program board of directors, as applicable.(b) The program shall provide for volunteers to serve as CASAs.  A CASA may be appointed in juvenile dependency proceedings under Section 300 and in actions to terminate parental rights to custody and control, as deemed appropriate by the juvenile or other superior court judge hearing the matter.(c) Each CASA shall serve at the pleasure of the court having jurisdiction over the proceedings in which a CASA has been appointed.  A CASA shall do all of the following:(1) Provide independent, factual information to the court regarding the cases to which he or she is appointed.(2) Represent the best interests of the children involved, and consider the best interests of the family, in the cases to which he or she is appointed.(3) At the request of the judge, monitor cases to which he or she has been appointed to assure that the court’s orders have been fulfilled.(d) The Judicial Council, through its rules and regulations, shall require an initial and ongoing training program consistent with this chapter to all persons acting as a CASA, including, but not limited to, each of the following:(1) Dynamics of child abuse and neglect.(2) Court structure, including juvenile court laws regarding dependency.(3) Social service systems.(4) Child development.(5) Interviewing techniques.(6) Educational rights and responsibilities, including the right of the child to receive special education and related services if the child has exceptional needs as described in Part 30 (commencing with Section 56000) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Education Code, or the right to receive accommodations if the child has disabilities as described in Chapter 16 of Title 29 of the United States Code Annotated.(7) Report writing.(8) Roles and responsibilities of a CASA.(9) Rules of evidence and discovery procedures.(10) Problems associated with verifying reports.(e) The Judicial Council, through its CASA Advisory Committee, shall adopt guidelines for the screening of CASA volunteers, which shall include personal interviews, reference checks, checks for records of sex offenses and other criminal records, information from the Department of Motor Vehicles, and other information as the Judicial Council deems appropriate.SEC. 3. Section 202 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:202. (a) The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the protection and safety of the public and each minor under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court and to preserve and strengthen the minor’s family ties whenever possible, removing the minor from the custody of his or her parents only when necessary for his or her welfare or for the safety and protection of the public.  When removal of a minor is determined by the juvenile court to be necessary, reunification of the minor with his or her family shall be a primary objective.  When the minor is removed from his or her own family, it is the purpose of this chapter to secure for the minor custody, care, and discipline as nearly as possible equivalent to that which should have been given by his or her parents.  This chapter shall be liberally construed to carry out these purposes.(b) Minors under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court who are in need of protective services shall receive care, treatment, guidance, and education, including special education and related services if the child has exceptional needs as described in Part 30 (commencing with Section 56000) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Education Code or the right to receive accommodations if the child has disabilities as described in Chapter 16 of Title 29 of the United States Code Annotated consistent with their best interest and the best interest of the public.  Minors under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court as a consequence of delinquent conduct shall, in conformity with the interests of public safety and protection, receive care, treatment and guidance which is consistent with their best interest, which holds them accountable for their behavior, and which is appropriate for their circumstances.  This guidance may include punishment that is consistent with the rehabilitative objectives of this chapter.  If a minor has been removed from the custody of his or her parents, family preservation and family reunification are appropriate goals for the juvenile court to consider when determining the disposition of a minor under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court as a consequence of delinquent conduct when those goals are consistent with his or her best interests and the best interests of the public.  When the minor is no longer a ward of the juvenile court, the guidance he or she received should enable him or her to be a law-abiding and productive member of his or her family and the community.(c) It is also the purpose of this chapter to reaffirm that the duty of a parent to support and maintain a minor child continues, subject to the financial ability of the parent to pay, during any period in which the minor may be declared a ward of the court and removed from the custody of the parent.(d) Juvenile courts and other public agencies charged with enforcing, interpreting, and administering the juvenile court law shall consider the safety and protection of the public, the importance of redressing injuries to victims, and the best interests of the minor in all deliberations pursuant to this chapter.  Participants in the juvenile justice system shall hold themselves accountable for its results.  They shall act in conformity with a comprehensive set of objectives established to improve system performance in a vigorous and ongoing manner.(e) As used in this chapter, “punishment” means the imposition of sanctions which include the following:(1) Payment of a fine by the minor.(2) Rendering of compulsory service without compensation performed for the benefit of the community by the minor.(3) Limitations on the minor’s liberty imposed as a condition of probation or parole.(4) Commitment of the minor to a local detention or treatment facility, such as a juvenile hall, camp, or ranch.(5) Commitment of the minor to the Department of the Youth Authority.“Punishment,” for the purposes of this chapter, does not include retribution.(f) In addition to the actions authorized by subdivision (e), the juvenile court may, as appropriate, direct the offender to complete a victim impact class, participate in victim offender conferencing subject to the victim’s consent, pay restitution to the victim or victims, and make a contribution to the victim restitution fund after all victim restitution orders and fines have been satisfied, in order to hold the offender accountable or restore the victim or community.SEC. 3.5. Section 202 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:202. (a) The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the protection and safety of the public and each minor under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court and to preserve and strengthen the minor’s family ties whenever possible, removing the minor from the custody of his or her parents only when necessary for his or her welfare or for the safety and protection of the public.  When removal of a minor is determined by the juvenile court to be necessary, reunification of the minor with his or her family shall be a primary objective.  When the minor is removed from his or her own family, it is the purpose of this chapter to secure for the minor custody, care, and discipline as nearly as possible equivalent to that which should have been given by his or her parents.  This chapter shall be liberally construed to carry out these purposes.(b) Minors under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court who are in need of protective services shall receive care, treatment, guidance, and education, including special education and related services if the child has exceptional needs as described in Part 30 (commencing with Section 56000) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Education Code or the right to receive accommodations if the child has disabilities as described in Chapter 16 of Title 29 of the United States Code  consistent with their best interest and the best interest of the public.  Minors under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court as a consequence of delinquent conduct shall, in conformity with the interests of public safety and protection, receive care, treatment and guidance that is consistent with their best interest, that holds them accountable for their behavior, and that is appropriate for their circumstances.  This guidance may include punishment that is consistent with the rehabilitative objectives of this chapter.  If a minor has been removed from the custody of his or her parents, family preservation and family reunification are appropriate goals for the juvenile court to consider when determining the disposition of a minor under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court as a consequence of delinquent conduct when those goals are consistent with his or her best interests and the best interests of the public.  When the minor is no longer a ward of the juvenile court, the guidance he or she received should enable him or her to be a law-abiding and productive member of his or her family and the community.(c) It is also the purpose of this chapter to reaffirm that the duty of a parent to support and maintain a minor child continues, subject to the financial ability of the parent to pay, during any period in which the minor may be declared a ward of the court and removed from the custody of the parent.(d) Juvenile courts and other public agencies charged with enforcing, interpreting, and administering the juvenile court law shall consider the safety and protection of the public, the importance of redressing injuries to victims, and the best interests of the minor in all deliberations pursuant to this chapter.  Participants in the juvenile justice system shall hold themselves accountable for its results.  They shall act in conformity with a comprehensive set of objectives established to improve system performance in a vigorous and ongoing manner.(e) As used in this chapter, “punishment” means the imposition of sanctions.  It shall not include a court order to place a child in foster care as defined by Section 727.3.  Permissible sanctions may include the following:(1) Payment of a fine by the minor.(2) Rendering of compulsory service without compensation performed for the benefit of the community by the minor.(3) Limitations on the minor’s liberty imposed as a condition of probation or parole.(4) Commitment of the minor to a local detention or treatment facility, such as a juvenile hall, camp, or ranch.(5) Commitment of the minor to the Department of the Youth Authority.“Punishment,” for the purposes of this chapter, does not include retribution.(f) In addition to the actions authorized by subdivision (e), the juvenile court may, as appropriate, direct the offender to complete a victim impact class, participate in victim offender conferencing subject to the victim’s consent, pay restitution to the victim or victims, and make a contribution to the victim restitution fund after all victim restitution orders and fines have been satisfied, in order to hold the offender accountable or restore the victim or community.SEC. 4. Section 209 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:209. (a) The judge of the juvenile court of a county, or, if there is more than one judge, any of the judges of the juvenile court shall, at least annually, inspect any jail, juvenile hall, or special purpose juvenile hall that, in the preceding calendar year, was used for confinement, for more than 24 hours, of any minor.The judge shall promptly notify the operator of the jail, juvenile hall, or special purpose juvenile hall of any observed noncompliance with minimum standards for juvenile facilities adopted by the Board of Corrections under Section 210.  Based on the facility’s subsequent compliance with the provisions of subdivisions (d) and (e), the judge shall thereafter make a finding whether the facility is a suitable place for the confinement of minors and shall note the finding in the minutes of the court.The Board of Corrections shall conduct a biennial inspection of each jail, juvenile hall, lockup, or special purpose juvenile hall situated in this state that, during the preceding calendar year, was used for confinement, for more than 24 hours, of any minor.  The board shall promptly notify the operator of any jail, juvenile hall, lockup, or special purpose juvenile hall of any noncompliance found, upon inspection, with any of the minimum standards for juvenile facilities adopted by the Board of Corrections under Section 210 or 210.2.If either a judge of the juvenile court or the board, after inspection of a jail, juvenile hall, special purpose juvenile hall, or lockup, finds that it is not being operated and maintained as a suitable place for the confinement of minors, the juvenile court or the board shall give notice of its finding to all persons having authority to confine minors pursuant to this chapter and commencing 60 days thereafter the facility shall not be used for confinement of minors until the time the judge or board, as the case may be, finds, after reinspection of the facility that the conditions that rendered the facility unsuitable have been remedied, and the facility is a suitable place for confinement of minors.The custodian of each jail, juvenile hall, special purpose juvenile hall, and lockup shall make any reports as may be requested by the board or the juvenile court to effectuate the purposes of this section.(b) The Board of Corrections may inspect any law enforcement facility that contains a lockup for adults and that it has reason to believe may not be in compliance with the requirements of subdivision (d) of Section 207.1 or with the certification requirements or standards adopted under Section 210.2.  A judge of the juvenile court shall conduct an annual inspection, either in person or through a delegated member of the appropriate county or regional juvenile justice commission, of any law enforcement facility that contains a lockup for adults which, in the preceding year, was used for the secure detention of any minor.  If the law enforcement facility is observed, upon inspection, to be out of compliance with the requirements of subdivision (d) of Section 207.1, or with any standard adopted under Section 210.2, the board or the judge shall promptly notify the operator of the law enforcement facility of the specific points of noncompliance.If either the judge or the board finds after inspection that the facility is not being operated and maintained in conformity with the requirements of subdivision (d) of Section 207.1 or with the certification requirements or standards adopted under Section 210.2, the juvenile court or the board shall give notice of its finding to all persons having authority to securely detain minors in the facility, and, commencing 60 days thereafter, the facility shall not be used for the secure detention of a minor until the time the judge or the board, as the case may be, finds, after reinspection, that the conditions that rendered the facility unsuitable have been remedied, and the facility is a suitable place for the confinement of minors in conformity with all requirements of law.The custodian of each law enforcement facility that contains a lockup for adults shall make any report as may be requested by the board or by the juvenile court to effectuate the purposes of this subdivision.(c) The board shall collect biennial data on the number, place, and duration of confinements of minors in jails and lockups, as defined in subdivision (i) of Section 207.1, and shall publish biennially this information in the form as it deems appropriate for the purpose of providing public information on continuing compliance with the requirements of Section 207.1.(d) Except as provided in subdivision (e), a juvenile hall, special purpose juvenile hall, law enforcement facility, or jail shall be unsuitable for the confinement of minors if it is not in compliance with one or more of the minimum standards for juvenile facilities adopted by the Board of Corrections under Section 210 or 210.2, and if, within 60 days of having received notice of noncompliance from the board or the judge of the juvenile court, the juvenile hall, special purpose juvenile hall, law enforcement facility, or jail has failed to file an approved corrective action plan with the Board of Corrections to correct the condition or conditions of noncompliance of which it has been notified.  The corrective action plan shall outline how the juvenile hall, special purpose juvenile hall, law enforcement facility, or jail plans to correct the issue of noncompliance and give a reasonable timeframe, not to exceed 90 days, for resolution, that the board shall either approve or deny.  In the event the juvenile hall, special purpose juvenile hall, law enforcement facility, or jail fails to meet its commitment to resolve noncompliance issues outlined in its corrective action plan, the board shall make a determination of suitability at its next scheduled meeting.(e) Where a juvenile hall is not in compliance with one or more of the minimum standards for juvenile facilities adopted by the Board of Corrections under Section 210, and where the noncompliance arises from sustained occupancy levels that are above the population capacity permitted by applicable minimum standards, the juvenile hall shall be unsuitable for the confinement of minors if the board or the judge of the juvenile court determines that conditions in the facility pose a serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of minors confined in the facility.  In making its determination of suitability, the board or the judge of the juvenile court shall consider, in addition to the noncompliance with minimum standards, the totality of conditions in the juvenile hall, including the extent and duration of overpopulation as well as staffing, program, physical plant, and medical and mental health care conditions and educational programs in the facility.  The Board of Corrections may develop guidelines and procedures for its determination of suitability in accordance with this subdivision and to assist counties in bringing their juvenile halls into full compliance with applicable minimum standards.  This subdivision shall not be interpreted to exempt a juvenile hall from having to correct, in accordance with the provisions of subdivision (d), any minimum standard violations that are not directly related to overpopulation of the facility.SEC. 5. Section 241.1 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:241.1. (a) Whenever a minor appears to come within the description of both Section 300 and Section 601 or 602, the county probation department and the county welfare department shall, pursuant to a jointly developed written protocol described in subdivision (b), initially determine which status will serve the best interests of the minor and the protection of society.  The recommendations of both departments shall be presented to the juvenile court with the petition that is filed on behalf of the minor, and the court shall determine which status is appropriate for the minor.  Any other juvenile court having jurisdiction over the minor shall receive notice from the court, within five calendar days, of the presentation of the recommendations of the departments.  The notice shall include the name of the judge to whom, or the courtroom to which, the recommendations were presented.(b) The probation department and the welfare department, in consultation with the appropriate local educational agency in each county shall jointly develop a written protocol to ensure appropriate local coordination in the assessment of a minor described in subdivision (a), and the development of recommendations by these departments for consideration by the juvenile court.  These protocols shall require, which requirements shall not be limited to, consideration of the nature of the referral, the age of the minor, the prior record of the minor’s parents for child abuse, the prior record of the minor for out-of-control or delinquent behavior, the parents’ cooperation with the minor’s school, the minor’s functioning at school, the minor’s educational needs, including the right to receive special education and related services if the child has exceptional needs as described in Part 30 (commencing with Section 56000) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Education Code and the right to receive accommodations if the child has disabilities as described in Chapter 16 of Title 29 of the United States Code Annotated, the nature of the minor’s home environment, and the records of other agencies which have been involved with the minor and his or her family.  The protocols also shall contain provisions for resolution of disagreements between the probation and welfare departments regarding the need for dependency or ward status and provisions for determining the circumstances under which a new petition should be filed to change the minor’s status.(c) Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the filing of a petition or petitions, or the entry of an order by the juvenile court, to make a minor simultaneously both a dependent child and a ward of the court.SEC. 6. Section 300.2 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:300.2. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the purpose of the provisions of this chapter relating to dependent children is to provide maximum safety and protection for children who are currently being physically, sexually, or emotionally abused, being neglected, or being exploited, and to ensure the safety, protection, and physical and emotional well-being of children who are at risk of that harm.  This safety, protection, and physical and emotional well-being may include provision of a full array of educational services, including special education and related services if the child has exceptional needs as described in Part 30 (commencing with Section 56000) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Education Code or accommodations if the child has disabilities as described in Chapter 16 of Title 29 of the United States Code Annotated, social and health services to help the child and family and to prevent reabuse of children.  The focus shall be on the preservation of the family as well as the safety, protection, and physical and emotional well-being of the child.  The provision of a home environment free from the negative effects of substance abuse is a necessary condition for the safety, protection and physical and emotional well-being of the child.  Successful participation in a treatment program for substance abuse may be considered in evaluating the home environment.  In addition, the provisions of this chapter ensuring the confidentiality of proceedings and records are intended to protect the privacy rights of the child.SEC. 7. Section 317 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:317. (a) When it appears to the court that a parent or guardian of the minor desires counsel but is presently financially unable to afford and cannot for that reason employ counsel, the court may appoint counsel as provided in this section.(b) When it appears to the court that a parent or guardian of the minor is presently financially unable to afford and cannot for that reason employ counsel, and the minor has been placed in out-of-home care, or the petitioning agency is recommending that the minor be placed in out-of-home care, the court shall appoint counsel, unless the court finds that the parent or guardian has made a knowing and intelligent waiver of counsel as provided in this section.(c) In any case in which it appears to the court that the minor would benefit from the appointment of counsel the court shall appoint counsel for the minor as provided in this section.  A primary responsibility of any counsel appointed to represent a minor pursuant to this section shall be to advocate for the minor’s educational rights, including the right to receive special education and related services if the child has exceptional needs as described in Part 30 (commencing with Section 56000) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Education Code and the right to receive accommodations if the child has disabilities as described in Chapter 16 of Title 29 of the United States Code Annotated, protection, safety, and physical and emotional well-being of the minor.  Counsel for the minor may be a county counsel, district attorney, public defender, or other member of the bar, provided that the counsel does not represent another party or county agency whose interests conflict with the minor’s.  The fact that the district attorney represents the minor in a proceeding pursuant to Section 300 as well as conducts a criminal investigation or files a criminal complaint or information arising from the same or reasonably related set of facts as the proceeding pursuant to Section 300 is not in and of itself a conflict of interest.  The court shall determine if representation of both the petitioning agency and the minor constitutes a conflict of interest.  If the court finds there is a conflict of interest, separate counsel shall be appointed for the minor.  The court may fix the compensation to be paid by the county for the services of appointed counsel, if counsel is not a county counsel, district attorney, public defender or other public attorney.(d) The counsel appointed by the court shall represent the parent, guardian, or minor at the detention hearing and at all subsequent proceedings before the juvenile court.  Counsel shall continue to represent the parent or minor unless relieved by the court upon the substitution of other counsel or for cause.  The representation shall include representing the parent or the minor in termination proceedings and in those proceedings relating to the institution or setting aside of a legal guardianship.(e) The counsel for the minor shall be charged in general with the representation of the minor’s interests.  To that end, the counsel shall make or cause to have made any further investigations that he or she deems in good faith to be reasonably necessary to ascertain the facts, including the interviewing of witnesses, and he or she shall examine and cross-examine witnesses in both the adjudicatory and dispositional hearings.  He or she may also introduce and examine his or her own witnesses, make recommendations to the court concerning the minor’s welfare, and participate further in the proceedings to the degree necessary to adequately represent the minor.  In any case in which the minor is four years of age or older, counsel shall interview the minor to determine the minor’s wishes and to assess the minor’s well-being, and shall advise the court of the minor’s wishes.  Counsel for the minor shall not advocate for the return of the minor if, to the best of his or her knowledge, that return conflicts with the protection and safety of the minor.  In addition counsel shall investigate the interests of the minor beyond the scope of the juvenile proceeding and report to the court other interests of the minor that may need to be protected by the institution of other administrative or judicial proceedings.  The attorney representing a child in a dependency proceeding is not required to assume the responsibilities of a social worker and is not expected to provide nonlegal services to the child.  The court shall take whatever appropriate action is necessary to fully protect the interests of the minor.(f) Notwithstanding any other law, counsel shall be given access to all records relevant to the case which are maintained by state or local public agencies.  All information requested from a child protective agency regarding a child who is in protective custody, or from a child’s guardian ad litem, shall be provided to the child’s counsel within 30 days of the request. Counsel shall be given access to records maintained by hospitals or by other medical or nonmedical practitioners or by child care custodians, in the manner prescribed by Section 1158 of the Evidence Code.(g) In a county of the third class, if counsel is to be provided to a minor at county expense other than by counsel for the agency, the court shall first utilize the services of the public defender prior to appointing private counsel, to provide legal counsel.  Nothing in this subdivision shall be construed to require the appointment of the public defender in any case in which the public defender has a conflict of interest.  In the interest of justice, a court may depart from that portion of the procedure requiring appointment of the public defender after making a finding of good cause and stating the reasons therefor on the record.(h) In a county of the third class, if counsel is to be appointed for a parent or guardian at county expense, the court shall first utilize the services of the alternate public defender, prior to appointing private counsel, to provide legal counsel.  Nothing in this subdivision shall be construed to require the appointment of the alternate public defender in any case in which the public defender has a conflict of interest.  In the interest of justice, a court may depart from that portion of the procedure requiring appointment of the alternate public defender after making a finding of good cause and stating the reasons therefor on the record.SEC. 8. Section 358.1 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:358.1. Each social study or evaluation made by a social worker or child advocate appointed by the court, required to be received in evidence pursuant to Section 358, shall include, but not be limited to, a factual discussion of each of the following subjects:(a) Whether the county welfare department or social worker has considered child protective services, as defined in Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 16500) of Part 4 of Division 9, as a possible solution to the problems at hand, and has offered these services to qualified parents if appropriate under the circumstances.(b) What plan, if any, for return of the child to his or her parents and for achieving legal permanence for the child if efforts to reunify fail, is recommended to the court by the county welfare department or probation officer.(c) Whether the best interests of the child will be served by granting reasonable visitation rights with the child to his or her grandparents, in order to maintain and strengthen the child’s family relationships.(d) Whether the subject child appears to be a person who is eligible to be considered for further court action to free the child from parental custody and control.  (e) Whether the parent has been advised of his or her option to participate in adoption planning and to voluntarily relinquish the child for adoption if an adoption agency is willing to accept the relinquishment.(f) The appropriateness of any relative placement pursuant to Section 361.3; however, this consideration shall not be cause for continuance of the dispositional hearing.(g) Whether the child has been or will be referred to educational services and what services the child is receiving, including special education and related services if the child has exceptional needs as described in Part 30 (commencing with Section 56000) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Education Code or accommodations if the child has disabilities as described in Chapter 16 of Title 29 of the United States Code Annotated.  The social worker or child advocate shall solicit comments from the appropriate local education agency prior to completion of the social study.(h) Whether the right of the parent or guardian to make educational decisions for the child should be limited by the court pursuant to Section 7579.5 of the Government Code.SEC. 8.5. Section 358.1 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:358.1. Each social study or evaluation made by a social worker or child advocate appointed by the court, required to be received in evidence pursuant to Section 358, shall include, but not be limited to, a factual discussion of each of the following subjects:(a) Whether the county welfare department or social worker has considered child protective services, as defined in Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 16500) of Part 4 of Division 9, as a possible solution to the problems at hand, and has offered these services to qualified parents if appropriate under the circumstances.(b) What plan, if any, for return of the child to his or her parents and for achieving legal permanence for the child if efforts to reunify fail, is recommended to the court by the county welfare department or probation officer.(c) Whether the best interests of the child will be served by granting reasonable visitation rights with the child to his or her grandparents, in order to maintain and strengthen the child’s family relationships.(d) Whether the subject child appears to be a person who is eligible to be considered for further court action to free the child from parental custody and control.(e) Whether the parent has been advised of his or her option to participate in adoption planning and to voluntarily relinquish the child for adoption if an adoption agency is willing to accept the relinquishment.(f) The appropriateness of any relative placement pursuant to Section 361.3; however, this consideration shall not be cause for continuance of the dispositional hearing.(g) Whether the child has been or will be referred to educational services and what services the child is receiving, including special education and related services if the child has exceptional needs as described in Part 30 (commencing with Section 56000) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Education Code or accommodations if the child has disabilities as described in Chapter 16 of Title 29 of the United States Code Annotated.  The social worker or child advocate shall solicit comments from the appropriate local education agency prior to completion of the social study.(h) Whether the right of the parent or guardian to make educational decisions for the child should be limited by the court pursuant to Section 7579.5 of the Government Code.(i) In every proceeding involving a foster child, whether the foster parent was interviewed, and any information obtained from the foster parent.(j) For purposes of this section, the term “foster parent” pertains to the child’s current caregiver and includes a foster parent, relative caregiver, or certified foster parent who has been approved to adopt the child by a licensed adoption agency.SEC. 9. Section 360 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:360. After receiving and considering the evidence on the proper disposition of the case, the juvenile court may enter judgment as follows:(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if the court finds that the child is a person described by Section 300 and the parent has advised the court that the parent is not interested in family maintenance or family reunification services, it may, in addition to or in lieu of adjudicating the child a dependent child of the court, order a legal guardianship, appoint a legal guardian, and issue letters of guardianship, if the court determines that a guardianship is in the best interest of the child, provided the parent and the child agree to the guardianship, unless the child’s age or physical, emotional, or mental condition prevents the child’s meaningful response.  The court shall advise the parent and the child that no reunification services will be provided as a result of the establishment of a guardianship.  The proceeding for the appointment of a guardian shall be in the juvenile court.Any application for termination of guardianship shall be filed in juvenile court in a form as may be developed by the Judicial Council pursuant to Section 68511 of the Government Code.  Section 388 shall apply to this order of guardianship.No person shall be appointed a legal guardian under this section until an assessment as specified in subdivision (g) of Section 361.5 is read and considered by the court and reflected in the minutes of the court.  The assessment shall include the following:(1) Current search efforts for, and notification of, a noncustodial parent in the manner provided in Section 337.(2) A review of the amount of and nature of any contact between the child and his or her parents since the filing of the petition.(3) An evaluation of the child’s medical, developmental, scholastic, mental, and emotional status.  The evaluation of the minor’s scholastic status shall include whether the child has been identified as having exceptional needs as described in Part 30 (commencing with Section 56000) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Education Code or disabilities justifying accommodations as described in Chapter 16 of Title 29 of the United States Code Annotated; and any information concerning whether the right of the parent or guardian to make educational decisions for the child has previously been limited by the court under Section 7579.5 of the Government Code; and whether the parent or guardian has previously designated an educational representative.(4) A preliminary assessment of the eligibility and commitment of any identified prospective guardian, particularly the caretaker, to include a social history including a screening for criminal records and prior referrals for child abuse or neglect, the capability to meet the child’s needs, and the understanding of the legal and financial rights and responsibilities of guardianship.(5) The relationship of the child to any identified prospective guardian, the duration and nature of the relationship, the motivation for seeking guardianship, and a statement from the child concerning the guardianship, unless the child’s age or physical, emotional, or other condition precludes the child’s meaningful response, and if so, a description of the condition.(6) An analysis of the likelihood that the child would be adopted if parental rights were terminated.The person responsible for preparing the assessment may be called and examined by any party to the guardianship proceeding.(b) If the court finds that the child is a person described by Section 300, it may, without adjudicating the child a dependent child of the court, order that services be provided to keep the family together and place the child and the child’s parent or guardian under the supervision of the social worker for a time period consistent with Section 301.(c) If the family subsequently is unable or unwilling to cooperate with the services being provided, the social worker may file a petition with the juvenile court pursuant to Section 332 alleging that a previous petition has been sustained and that disposition pursuant to subdivision (b) has been ineffective in ameliorating the situation requiring the child welfare services.  Upon hearing the petition, the court shall order either that the petition shall be dismissed or that a new disposition hearing shall be held pursuant to subdivision (d).(d) If the court finds that the child is a person described by Section 300, it may order and adjudge the child to be a dependent child of the court.SEC. 10. Section 361 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:361. (a) In all cases in which a minor is adjudged a dependent child of the court on the ground that the minor is a person described by Section 300, the court may limit the control to be exercised over the dependent child by any parent or guardian and shall by its order clearly and specifically set forth all those limitations.  The court shall consider the educational needs of the child, and if appropriate, proceed under Section 56156 of the Education Code and Section 7579.5 of the Government Code.  Any limitation on the right of the parent or guardian to make educational decisions for the child shall be specifically addressed in the court order. The limitations shall not exceed those necessary to protect the child.Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no person shall be appointed to make educational decisions concerning a child if that person is employed by a licensed childrens’ institution, as defined in Section 56155.5 of the Education Code, or any nonpublic, nonsectarian school or agency affiliated with a licensed childrens’ institution in which the child may be placed or if that person has any other, similar conflict of interest in determining the placement of the child.(b) Nothing in subdivision (a) shall be construed to limit the ability of a parent to voluntarily relinquish his or her child to the State Department of Social Services or to a licensed county adoption agency at any time while the child is a dependent child of the juvenile court if the department or agency is willing to accept the relinquishment.(c) No dependent child shall be taken from the physical custody of his or her parents or guardian or guardians with whom the child resides at the time the petition was initiated unless the juvenile court finds clear and convincing evidence of any of the following:(1) There is a substantial danger to the physical health, safety, protection, or physical or emotional well-being of the minor or would be if the minor were returned home, and there are no reasonable means by which the minor’s physical health can be protected without removing the minor from the minor’s parents’ or guardians’ physical custody.  The fact that a minor has been adjudicated a dependent child of the court pursuant to subdivision (e) of Section 300 shall constitute prima facie evidence that the minor cannot be safely left in the custody of the parent or guardian with whom the minor resided at the time of injury.  The court shall consider, as a reasonable means to protect the minor, the option of removing an offending parent or guardian from the home.  The court shall also consider, as a reasonable means to protect the minor, allowing a nonoffending parent or guardian to retain custody as long as that parent or guardian presents a plan acceptable to the court demonstrating that he or she will be able to protect the child from future harm.(2) The parent or guardian of the minor is unwilling to have physical custody of the minor, and the parent or guardian has been notified that if the minor remains out of their physical custody for the period specified in Section 366.25 or 366.26, the minor may be declared permanently free from their custody and control.(3) The minor is suffering severe emotional damage, as indicated by extreme anxiety, depression, withdrawal, or untoward aggressive behavior toward self or others, and there are no reasonable means by which the minor’s emotional health may be protected without removing the minor from the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian.(4) The minor or a sibling of the minor has been sexually abused, or is deemed to be at substantial risk of being sexually abused, by a parent, guardian, or member of his or her household, or other person known to his or her parent, and there are no reasonable means by which the minor can be protected from further sexual abuse or a substantial risk of sexual abuse without removing the minor from his or her parent or guardian, or the minor does not wish to return to his or her parent or guardian.(5) The minor has been left without any provision for his or her support, or a parent who has been incarcerated or institutionalized cannot arrange for the care of the minor, or a relative or other adult custodian with whom the child has been left by the parent is unwilling or unable to provide care or support for the child and the whereabouts of the parent is unknown and reasonable efforts to locate him or her have been unsuccessful.(d) The court shall make a determination as to whether reasonable efforts were made to prevent or to eliminate the need for removal of the minor from his or her home or, if the minor is removed for one of the reasons stated in paragraph (5) of subdivision (c), whether it was reasonable under the circumstances not to make any of those efforts.  The court shall state the facts on which the decision to remove the minor is based.(e) The court shall make all of the findings required by subdivision (a) of Section 366 in either of the following circumstances:(1) The minor has been taken from the custody of his or her parent or guardian and has been living in an out-of-home placement pursuant to Section 319.(2) The minor has been living in a voluntary out-of-home placement pursuant to Section 16507.4.SEC. 10.5. Section 361 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:361. (a) In all cases in which a minor is adjudged a dependent child of the court on the ground that the minor is a person described by Section 300, the court may limit the control to be exercised over the dependent child by any parent or guardian and shall by its order clearly and specifically set forth all those limitations.  The court shall consider the educational needs of the child, and if appropriate, proceed under Section 56156 of the Education Code and Section 7579.5 of the Government Code.  Any limitation on the right of the parent or guardian to make educational decisions for the child shall be specifically addressed in the court order as described in subdivision (f).  The limitations shall not exceed those necessary to protect the child.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no person shall be appointed to make educational decisions concerning a child if that person is employed by a licensed children’s institution, as defined in Section 56155.5 of the Education Code, or any nonpublic, nonsectarian school or agency affiliated with a licensed children’s institution in which the child may be placed or if that person has any other, similar conflict of interest in determining the placement of the child.(b) Nothing in subdivision (a) limits the ability of a parent to voluntarily relinquish his or her child to the State Department of Social Services or to a licensed county adoption agency at any time while the child is a dependent child of the juvenile court if the department or agency is willing to accept the relinquishment.(c) No dependent child shall be taken from the physical custody of his or her parents or guardian or guardians with whom the child resides at the time the petition was initiated unless the juvenile court finds clear and convincing evidence of any of the following:(1) There is a substantial danger to the physical health, safety, protection, or physical or emotional well-being of the minor or would be if the minor were returned home, and there are no reasonable means by which the minor’s physical health can be protected without removing the minor from the minor’s parents’ or guardians’ physical custody.  The fact that a minor has been adjudicated a dependent child of the court pursuant to subdivision (e) of Section 300 constitutes prima facie evidence that the minor cannot be safely left in the custody of the parent or guardian with whom the minor resided at the time of injury.  The court shall consider, as a reasonable means to protect the minor, the option of removing an offending parent or guardian from the home.  The court shall also consider, as a reasonable means to protect the minor, allowing a nonoffending parent or guardian to retain custody as long as that parent or guardian presents a plan acceptable to the court demonstrating that he or she will be able to protect the child from future harm.(2) The parent or guardian of the minor is unwilling to have physical custody of the minor, and the parent or guardian has been notified that if the minor remains out of their physical custody for the period specified in Section 366.25 or 366.26, the minor may be declared permanently free from their custody and control.(3) The minor is suffering severe emotional damage, as indicated by extreme anxiety, depression, withdrawal, or untoward aggressive behavior toward self or others, and there are no reasonable means by which the minor’s emotional health may be protected without removing the minor from the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian.(4) The minor or a sibling of the minor has been sexually abused, or is deemed to be at substantial risk of being sexually abused, by a parent, guardian, or member of his or her household, or other person known to his or her parent, and there are no reasonable means by which the minor can be protected from further sexual abuse or a substantial risk of sexual abuse without removing the minor from his or her parent or guardian, or the minor does not wish to return to his or her parent or guardian.(5) The minor has been left without any provision for his or her support, or a parent who has been incarcerated or institutionalized cannot arrange for the care of the minor, or a relative or other adult custodian with whom the child has been left by the parent is unwilling or unable to provide care or support for the child and the whereabouts of the parent is unknown and reasonable efforts to locate him or her have been unsuccessful.(d) The court shall make a determination as to whether reasonable efforts were made to prevent or to eliminate the need for removal of the minor from his or her home or, if the minor is removed for one of the reasons stated in paragraph (5) of subdivision (c), whether it was reasonable under the circumstances not to make any of those efforts.  The court shall state the facts on which the decision to remove the minor is based.(e) The court shall make all of the findings required by subdivision (a) of Section 366 in either of the following circumstances:(1) The minor has been taken from the custody of his or her parent or guardian and has been living in an out-of-home placement pursuant to Section 319.(2) The minor has been living in a voluntary out-of-home placement pursuant to Section 16507.4.(f) The court shall limit the right of a parent or guardian to make educational decisions for the child if one or more of the following applies to each of the child’s parents and the child’s guardian, if any, and the child is removed from the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian.(1) The parent of the child is unknown.(2) The whereabouts of the parent or guardian is unknown and efforts to locate the parent or guardian have been unsuccessful.(3) The child is a person described by subdivision (h) of Section 300.(4) The parent or guardian has been incarcerated or institutionalized and cannot arrange for care of the child.(5) The parent or guardian is deceased.(6) The parent or guardian will not be available to provide for the child’s educational needs due to the intention of the parent or guardian to enter a residential program or the case plan adopted by the court contains a recommendation for a residential treatment program.(7) The court is proceeding under subdivision (b) of Section 361.5.(8) The location of the residence of the parent or guardian prevents the parent or guardian from exercising timely in-person care for the child.(9) The parent or guardian is suffering from a mental disability as described in Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 7820) of Part 4 of Division 12 of the Family Code that renders him or her incapable of exercising the right to make educational decisions for the child.(g) The court may limit the right of a parent or guardian to make educational decisions for the child if one or more of the following applies to each of the child’s parents and the child’s guardian, if any, and the child is removed from the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian:(1) (A) The parent or guardian of the child has not demonstrated due diligence in providing for the child’s educational needs or attending to necessary matters pertaining to the child’s education, as demonstrated by a pattern of failure to do the following:(i) Attend meetings with the child’s teacher, when provided with notice of the meeting.(ii) Respond to problems relating to the child’s performance or behavior at school.(iii) Participate in implementation of the child’s individual educational plan if the child is an individual with exceptional needs.(iv) Ensure regular school attendance to a detrimental degree.(B) If the child comes within the description set forth in Section 601, this paragraph shall not apply.(2) The parent or guardian has demonstrated, without good cause, a pattern of unreliability in attending to routine responsibilities pertaining to the child’s care and welfare, including, but not limited to, failure by the parent or guardian to visit the child during the time the child has been detained in out-of-home care by the juvenile court, if the parent had access to transportation, unless the court has denied visitation.SEC. 11. Section 361.5 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:361.5. (a) Except as provided in subdivision (b) of this section or when the parent has voluntarily relinquished the child and the relinquishment has been filed with the State Department of Social Services, or upon the establishment of an order of guardianship pursuant to Section 360, whenever a child is removed from a parent’s or guardian’s custody, the juvenile court shall order the social worker to provide child welfare services to the child and the child’s mother and statutorily presumed father or guardians.  Upon a finding and declaration of paternity by the juvenile court or proof of a prior declaration of paternity by any court of competent jurisdiction, the juvenile court may order services for the child and the biological father, if the court determines that the services will benefit the child.  Child welfare services, when provided, shall be provided as follows:(1) For a child who, on the date of initial removal from the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian, was three years of age or older, court-ordered services shall not exceed a period of 12 months from the date the child entered foster care.(2) For a child who, on the date of initial removal from the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian, was under the age of three years, court-ordered services shall not exceed a period of six months from the date the child entered foster care.Regardless of the age of the child, a child shall be deemed to have entered foster care on the earlier of the date of the jurisdictional hearing held pursuant to Section 356 or the date that is 60 days after the date on which the child was initially removed from the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian.Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) and (2), court-ordered services may be extended up to a maximum time period not to exceed 18 months after the date the child was originally removed from physical custody of his or her parent or guardian if it can be shown, at the hearing held pursuant to subdivision (f) of Section 366.21, that the permanent plan for the child is that he or she will be returned and safely maintained in the home within the extended time period.  The court shall extend the time period only if it finds that there is a substantial probability that the child will be returned to the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian within the extended time period or that reasonable services have not been provided to the parent or guardian.  If the court extends the time period, the court shall specify the factual basis for its conclusion that there is a substantial probability that the child will be returned to the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian within the extended time period.  The court also shall make findings pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 366 and subdivision (e) of Section 358.1.When counseling or other treatment services are ordered, the parent or guardian shall be ordered to participate in those services, unless the parent’s or guardian’s participation is deemed by the court to be inappropriate or potentially detrimental to the child.  Physical custody of the child by the parents or guardians during the 12-month period shall not serve to interrupt the running of the period.  If at the end of the 12-month period, a child cannot be safely returned to the care and custody of a parent or guardian without court supervision, but the child clearly desires contact with the parent or guardian, the court shall take the child’s desire into account in devising a permanency plan.In cases where the child was under the age of three years on the date of the initial removal from the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian, the court shall inform the parent or guardian that the failure of the parent or guardian to participate regularly in any court-ordered treatment programs or to cooperate or avail himself or herself of services provided as part of the child welfare services case plan may result in a termination of efforts to reunify the family after six months.Except in cases where, pursuant to subdivision (b), the court does not order reunification services, the court shall inform the parent or parents of Section 366.26 and shall specify that the parent’s or parents’ parental rights may be terminated.(b) Reunification services need not be provided to a parent or guardian described in this subdivision when the court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, any of the following:(1) That the whereabouts of the parent or guardian is unknown.  A finding pursuant to this paragraph shall be supported by an affidavit or by proof that a reasonably diligent search has failed to locate the parent or guardian.  The posting or publication of notices is not required in that search.(2) That the parent or guardian is suffering from a mental disability that is described in Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 7820) of Part 4 of Division 12 of the Family Code and that renders him or her incapable of utilizing those services.(3) That the child or a sibling of the child has been previously adjudicated a dependent pursuant to any subdivision of Section 300 as a result of physical or sexual abuse, that following that adjudication the child had been removed from the custody of his or her parent or guardian pursuant to Section 361, that the child has been returned to the custody of the parent or guardian from whom the child had been taken originally, and that the child is being removed pursuant to Section 361, due to additional physical or sexual abuse.(4) That the parent or guardian of the child has caused the death of another child through abuse or neglect.(5) That the child was brought within the jurisdiction of the court under subdivision (e) of Section 300 because of the conduct of that parent or guardian.(6) That the child has been adjudicated a dependent pursuant to any subdivision of Section 300 as a result of severe sexual abuse or the infliction of severe physical harm to the child, a sibling, or a half-sibling by a parent or guardian, as defined in this subdivision, and the court makes a factual finding that it would not benefit the child to pursue reunification services with the offending parent or guardian.A finding of severe sexual abuse, for the purposes of this subdivision, may be based on, but is not limited to, sexual intercourse, or stimulation involving genital-genital, oral-genital, anal-genital, or oral-anal contact, whether between the parent or guardian and the child or a sibling or half-sibling of the child, or between the child or a sibling or half-sibling of the child and another person or animal with the actual or implied consent of the parent or guardian; or the penetration or manipulation of the child’s, sibling’s, or half-sibling’s genital organs or rectum by any animate or inanimate object for the sexual gratification of the parent or guardian, or for the sexual gratification of another person with the actual or implied consent of the parent or guardian.A finding of the infliction of severe physical harm, for the purposes of this subdivision, may be based on, but is not limited to, deliberate and serious injury inflicted to or on a child’s body or the body of a sibling or half-sibling of the child by an act or omission of the parent or guardian, or of another individual or animal with the consent of the parent or guardian; deliberate and torturous confinement of the child, sibling, or half-sibling in a closed space; or any other torturous act or omission that would be reasonably understood to cause serious emotional damage.(7) That the parent is not receiving reunification services for a sibling or a half-sibling of the child pursuant to paragraph (3), (5), or (6).(8) That the child was conceived by means of the commission of an offense listed in Section 288 or 288.5 of the Penal Code, or by an act committed outside of this state that, if committed in this state,would constitute one of those offenses.  This paragraph only applies to the parent who committed the offense or act.(9) That the child has been found to be a child described in subdivision (g) of Section 300, that the parent or guardian of the child willfully abandoned the child, and the court finds that the abandonment itself constituted a serious danger to the child.  For the purposes of this paragraph, “serious danger” means that without the intervention of another person or agency, the child would have sustained severe or permanent disability, injury, illness, or death.  For purposes of this paragraph, “willful abandonment” shall not be construed as actions taken in good faith by the parent without the intent of placing the child in serious danger.(10) That (A) the court ordered a permanent plan of adoption, guardianship, or long-term foster care for any siblings or half-siblings of the child because the parent or guardian failed to reunify with the sibling or half-sibling after the sibling or half-sibling had been removed from that parent or guardian pursuant to Section 361 and that parent or guardian is the same parent or guardian described in subdivision (a), or (B) the parental rights of a parent or guardian over any sibling or half-sibling of the child had been permanently severed, and that, according to the findings of the court, this parent or guardian has not subsequently made a reasonable effort to treat the problems that led to removal of the sibling or half-sibling of that child from that parent or guardian.(11) That the parent or guardian of the child has been convicted of a violent felony, as defined in subdivision (c) of Section 667.5 of the Penal Code.(12) That the parent or guardian of the child has a history of extensive, abusive, and chronic use of drugs or alcohol and has resisted prior treatment for this problem during a three-year period immediately prior to the filing of the petition that brought that child to the court’s attention, or has failed or refused to comply with a program of drug or alcohol treatment described in the case plan required by Section 358.1 on at least two prior occasions, even though the programs identified were available and accessible.(13) That the parent or guardian of the child has advised the court that he or she is not interested in receiving family maintenance or family reunification services or having the child returned to or placed in his or her custody and does not wish to receive family maintenance or reunification services.The parent or guardian shall be represented by counsel and shall execute a waiver of services form to be adopted by the Judicial Council.  The court shall advise the parent or guardian of any right to services and of the possible consequences of a waiver of services, including the termination of parental rights and placement of the child for adoption.  The court shall not accept the waiver of services unless it states on the record its finding that the parent or guardian has knowingly and intelligently waived the right to services.(14) That the parent or guardian has on one or more occasions willfully abducted the child or child’s sibling or half-sibling from his or her placement and refused to disclose the child’s or child’s sibling or half-sibling’s whereabouts, refused to return physical custody of the child or child’s sibling or half-sibling to his or her placement, or refused to return physical custody of the child or child’s sibling or half-sibling to the social worker.(c) In deciding whether to order reunification in any case in which this section applies, the court shall hold a dispositional hearing.  The social worker shall prepare a report that discusses whether reunification services shall be provided.  When it is alleged, pursuant to paragraph (2) of subdivision (b), that the parent is incapable of utilizing services due to mental disability, the court shall order reunification services unless competent evidence from mental health professionals establishes that, even with the provision of services, the parent is unlikely to be capable of adequately caring for the child within the time limits specified in subdivision (a).The court shall not order reunification for a parent or guardian described in paragraph (3), (4), (6), (7), (8), (9), (10), (11), (12), (13), or (14) of subdivision (b) unless the court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that reunification is in the best interest of the child.In addition, the court shall not order reunification in any situation described in paragraph (5) of subdivision (b) unless it finds that, based on competent testimony, those services are likely to prevent reabuse or continued neglect of the child or that failure to try reunification will be detrimental to the child because the child is closely and positively attached to that parent.  The social worker shall investigate the circumstances leading to the removal of the child and advise the court whether there are circumstances that indicate that reunification is likely to be successful or unsuccessful and whether failure to order reunification is likely to be detrimental to the child.The failure of the parent to respond to previous services, the fact that the child was abused while the parent was under the influence of drugs or alcohol, a past history of violent behavior, or testimony by a competent professional that the parent’s behavior is unlikely to be changed by services are among the factors indicating that reunification services are unlikely to be successful.  The fact that a parent or guardian is no longer living with an individual who severely abused the child may be considered in deciding that reunification services are likely to be successful, provided that the court shall consider any pattern of behavior on the part of the parent that has exposed the child to repeated abuse.(d) If reunification services are not ordered pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) and the whereabouts of a parent become known within six months of the out-of-home placement of the child, the court shall order the social worker to provide family reunification services in accordance with this subdivision.(e) (1) If the parent or guardian is incarcerated or institutionalized, the court shall order reasonable services unless the court determines, by clear and convincing evidence, those services would be detrimental to the child.  In determining detriment, the court shall consider the age of the child, the degree of parent-child bonding, the length of the sentence, the nature of the treatment, the nature of the crime or illness, the degree of detriment to the child if services are not offered and, for children 10 years of age or older, the child’s attitude toward the implementation of family reunification services, and any other appropriate factors. Reunification services are subject to the 12-month limitation imposed in subdivision (a).  Services may include, but shall not be limited to, all of the following:(A) Maintaining contact between the parent and child through collect telephone calls.(B) Transportation services, where appropriate.(C) Visitation services, where appropriate.(D) Reasonable services to extended family members or foster parents providing care for the child if the services are not detrimental to the child.An incarcerated parent may be required to attend counseling, parenting classes, or vocational training programs as part of the service plan if these programs are available.(2) The presiding judge of the juvenile court of each county may convene representatives of the county welfare department, the sheriff’s department, and other appropriate entities for the purpose of developing and entering into protocols for ensuring the notification, transportation, and presence of an incarcerated or institutionalized parent at all court hearings involving proceedings affecting the child pursuant to Section 2625 of the Penal Code.(3) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if the incarcerated parent is a woman seeking to participate in the community treatment program operated by the Department of Corrections pursuant to Chapter 4.8 (commencing with Section 1174) of Title 7 of Part 2 of, Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 3410) of Title 2 of Part 3 of, the Penal Code, the court shall determine whether the parent’s participation in a program is in the child’s best interest and whether it is suitable to meet the needs of the parent and child.(f) If the court, pursuant to paragraph (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), (10), (11), (12), (13), or (14) of subdivision (b) or paragraph (1) of subdivision (e), does not order reunification services, it shall, at the dispositional hearing, that shall include a permanency hearing, determine if a hearing under Section 366.26 shall be set in order to determine whether adoption, guardianship, or long-term foster care is the most appropriate plan for the child.  If the court so determines, it shall conduct the hearing pursuant to Section 366.26 within 120 days after the dispositional hearing. However, the court shall not schedule a hearing so long as the other parent is being provided reunification services pursuant to subdivision (a).  The court may continue to permit the parent to visit the child unless it finds that visitation would be detrimental to the child.(g) Whenever a court orders that a hearing shall be held pursuant to Section 366.26, it shall direct the agency supervising the child and the licensed county adoption agency, or the State Department of Social Services when it is acting as an adoption agency in counties that are not served by a county adoption agency, to prepare an assessment that shall include:(1) Current search efforts for an absent parent or parents.(2) A review of the amount of and nature of any contact between the child and his or her parents and other members of his or her extended family since the time of placement.  Although the extended family of each child shall be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, “extended family” for the purpose of this paragraph shall include, but not be limited to, the child’s siblings, grandparents, aunts, and uncles.(3) An evaluation of the child’s medical, developmental, scholastic, mental, and emotional status.  The evaluation of the minor’s scholastic status shall include whether the child has been identified as having exceptional needs as described in Part 30 (commencing with Section 56000) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Education Code or disabilities justifying accommodations as described in Chapter 16 of Title 29 of the United States Code Annotated; and any information concerning whether the right of the parent or guardian to make educational decisions for the child has previously been limited by the court under Section 7579.5 of the Government Code; and whether the parent or guardian has previously designated and educational representative.(4) A preliminary assessment of the eligibility and commitment of any identified prospective adoptive parent or guardian, particularly the caretaker, to include a social history including screening for criminal records and prior referrals for child abuse or neglect, the capability to meet the child’s needs, and the understanding of the legal and financial rights and responsibilities of adoption and guardianship.  If a proposed guardian is a relative of the minor, and the relative was assessed for foster care placement of the minor prior to January 1, 1998, the assessment shall also consider, but need not be limited to, all of the factors specified in subdivision (a) of Section 361.3.  As used in this paragraph, “relative” means an adult who is related to the minor by blood, adoption, or affinity within the fifth degree of kinship, including stepparents, stepsiblings, and all relatives whose status is preceded by the words “great,” “great-great,” or “grand,” or the spouse of any of those persons even if the marriage was terminated by death or dissolution.(5) The relationship of the child to any identified prospective adoptive parent or guardian, the duration and character of the relationship, the motivation for seeking adoption or guardianship, and a statement from the child concerning placement and the adoption or guardianship, unless the child’s age or physical, emotional, or other condition precludes his or her meaningful response, and if so, a description of the condition.(6) An analysis of the likelihood that the child will be adopted if parental rights are terminated.(h) In determining whether reunification services will benefit the child pursuant to paragraph (6) or (7) of subdivision (b), the court shall consider any information it deems relevant, including the following factors:(1) The specific act or omission comprising the severe sexual abuse or the severe physical harm inflicted on the child or the child’s sibling or half-sibling.(2) The circumstances under which the abuse or harm was inflicted on the child or the child’s sibling or half-sibling.(3) The severity of the emotional trauma suffered by the child or the child’s sibling or half-sibling.(4) Any history of abuse of other children by the offending parent or guardian.(5) The likelihood that the child may be safely returned to the care of the offending parent or guardian within 12 months with no continuing supervision.(6) Whether or not the child desires to be reunified with the offending parent or guardian.(i) The court shall read into the record the basis for a finding of severe sexual abuse or the infliction of severe physical harm under paragraph (6) of subdivision (b), and shall also specify the factual findings used to determine that the provision of reunification services to the offending parent or guardian would not benefit the child.SEC. 11.1. Section 361.5 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:361.5. (a) Except as provided in subdivision (b) of this section or when the parent has voluntarily relinquished the child and the relinquishment has been filed with the State Department of Social Services, or upon the establishment of an order of guardianship pursuant to Section 360, whenever a child is removed from a parent’s or guardian’s custody, the juvenile court shall order the social worker to provide child welfare services to the child and the child’s mother and statutorily presumed father or guardians.  Upon a finding and declaration of paternity by the juvenile court or proof of a prior declaration of paternity by any court of competent jurisdiction, the juvenile court may order services for the child and the biological father, if the court determines that the services will benefit the child.  Child welfare services, when provided, shall be provided as follows:(1) For a child who, on the date of initial removal from the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian, was three years of age or older, court-ordered services shall not exceed a period of 12 months from the date the child entered foster care, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (3).(2) For a child who, on the date of initial removal from the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian, was under the age of three years, court-ordered services shall not exceed a period of six months from the date the child entered foster care.(3) For the purpose of placing and maintaining a sibling group together in a permanent home should reunification efforts fail, for a child in a sibling group whose members were removed from parental custody at the same time, and in which one member of the sibling group was under the age of three years on the date of initial removal from the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian, court-ordered services to some or all of the sibling group may be limited to a period of six months from the date the child entered foster care.  For the purposes of this paragraph, “a sibling group” shall mean two or more children who are related to each other as full or half-siblings.Regardless of the age of the child, a child shall be deemed to have entered foster care on the earlier of the date of the jurisdictional hearing held pursuant to Section 356 or the date that is 60 days after the date on which the child was initially removed from the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian.Notwithstanding paragraphs (1), (2), and (3), court-ordered services may be extended up to a maximum time period not to exceed 18 months after the date the child was originally removed from physical custody of his or her parent or guardian if it can be shown, at the hearing held pursuant to subdivision (f) of Section 366.21, that the permanent plan for the child is that he or she will be returned and safely maintained in the home within the extended time period.  The court shall extend the time period only if it finds that there is a substantial probability that the child will be returned to the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian within the extended time period or that reasonable services have not been provided to the parent or guardian.  If the court extends the time period, the court shall specify the factual basis for its conclusion that there is a substantial probability that the child will be returned to the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian within the extended time period.  The court also shall make findings pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 366 and subdivision (e) of Section 358.1.When counseling or other treatment services are ordered, the parent or guardian shall be ordered to participate in those services, unless the parent’s or guardian’s participation is deemed by the court to be inappropriate or potentially detrimental to the child.  Physical custody of the child by the parents or guardians during the applicable time period under paragraph (1), (2), or (3) shall not serve to interrupt the running of the period.  If at the end of the applicable time period, a child cannot be safely returned to the care and custody of a parent or guardian without court supervision, but the child clearly desires contact with the parent or guardian, the court shall take the child’s desire into account in devising a permanency plan.In cases where the child was under the age of three years on the date of the initial removal from the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian or is a member of a sibling group as described in paragraph (3), the court shall inform the parent or guardian that the failure of the parent or guardian to participate regularly in any court-ordered treatment programs or to cooperate or avail himself or herself of services provided as part of the child welfare services case plan may result in a termination of efforts to reunify the family after six months.  The court shall inform the parent or guardian of the factors used in subdivision (e) of Section 366.21 to determine whether to limit services to six months for some or all members of a sibling group as described in paragraph (3).Except in cases where, pursuant to subdivision (b), the court does not order reunification services, the court shall inform the parent or parents of Section 366.26 and shall specify that the parent’s or parents’ parental rights may be terminated.(b) Reunification services need not be provided to a parent or guardian described in this subdivision when the court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, any of the following:(1) That the whereabouts of the parent or guardian is unknown.  A finding pursuant to this paragraph shall be supported by an affidavit or by proof that a reasonably diligent search has failed to locate the parent or guardian.  The posting or publication of notices is not required in that search.(2) That the parent or guardian is suffering from a mental disability that is described in Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 7820) of Part 4 of Division 12 of the Family Code and that renders him or her incapable of utilizing those services.(3) That the child or a sibling of the child has been previously adjudicated a dependent pursuant to any subdivision of Section 300 as a result of physical or sexual abuse, that following that adjudication the child had been removed from the custody of his or her parent or guardian pursuant to Section 361, that the child has been returned to the custody of the parent or guardian from whom the child had been taken originally, and that the child is being removed pursuant to Section 361, due to additional physical or sexual abuse.(4) That the parent or guardian of the child has caused the death of another child through abuse or neglect.(5) That the child was brought within the jurisdiction of the court under subdivision (e) of Section 300 because of the conduct of that parent or guardian.(6) That the child has been adjudicated a dependent pursuant to any subdivision of Section 300 as a result of severe sexual abuse or the infliction of severe physical harm to the child, a sibling, or a half-sibling by a parent or guardian, as defined in this subdivision, and the court makes a factual finding that it would not benefit the child to pursue reunification services with the offending parent or guardian.A finding of severe sexual abuse, for the purposes of this subdivision, may be based on, but is not limited to, sexual intercourse, or stimulation involving genital-genital, oral-genital, anal-genital, or oral-anal contact, whether between the parent or guardian and the child or a sibling or half-sibling of the child, or between the child or a sibling or half-sibling of the child and another person or animal with the actual or implied consent of the parent or guardian; or the penetration or manipulation of the child’s, sibling’s, or half-sibling’s genital organs or rectum by any animate or inanimate object for the sexual gratification of the parent or guardian, or for the sexual gratification of another person with the actual or implied consent of the parent or guardian.A finding of the infliction of severe physical harm, for the purposes of this subdivision, may be based on, but is not limited to, deliberate and serious injury inflicted to or on a child’s body or the body of a sibling or half-sibling of the child by an act or omission of the parent or guardian, or of another individual or animal with the consent of the parent or guardian; deliberate and torturous confinement of the child, sibling, or half-sibling in a closed space; or any other torturous act or omission that would be reasonably understood to cause serious emotional damage.(7) That the parent is not receiving reunification services for a sibling or a half-sibling of the child pursuant to paragraph (3), (5), or (6).(8) That the child was conceived by means of the commission of an offense listed in Section 288 or 288.5 of the Penal Code, or by an act committed outside of this state that, if committed in this state, would constitute one of those offenses.  This paragraph only applies to the parent who committed the offense or act.(9) That the child has been found to be a child described in subdivision (g) of Section 300, that the parent or guardian of the child willfully abandoned the child, and the court finds that the abandonment itself constituted a serious danger to the child.  For the purposes of this paragraph, “serious danger” means that without the intervention of another person or agency, the child would have sustained severe or permanent disability, injury, illness, or death.  For purposes of this paragraph, “willful abandonment” shall not be construed as actions taken in good faith by the parent without the intent of placing the child in serious danger.(10) That (A) the court ordered a permanent plan of adoption, guardianship, or long-term foster care for any siblings or half-siblings of the child because the parent or guardian failed to reunify with the sibling or half-sibling after the sibling or half-sibling had been removed from that parent or guardian pursuant to Section 361 and that parent or guardian is the same parent or guardian described in subdivision (a), or (B) the parental rights of a parent or guardian over any sibling or half-sibling of the child had been permanently severed, and that, according to the findings of the court, this parent or guardian has not subsequently made a reasonable effort to treat the problems that led to removal of the sibling or half-sibling of that child from that parent or guardian.(11) That the parent or guardian of the child has been convicted of a violent felony, as defined in subdivision (c) of Section 667.5 of the Penal Code.(12) That the parent or guardian of the child has a history of extensive, abusive, and chronic use of drugs or alcohol and has resisted prior treatment for this problem during a three-year period immediately prior to the filing of the petition that brought that child to the court’s attention, or has failed or refused to comply with a program of drug or alcohol treatment described in the case plan required by Section 358.1 on at least two prior occasions, even though the programs identified were available and accessible.(13) That the parent or guardian of the child has advised the court that he or she is not interested in receiving family maintenance or family reunification services or having the child returned to or placed in his or her custody and does not wish to receive family maintenance or reunification services.The parent or guardian shall be represented by counsel and shall execute a waiver of services form to be adopted by the Judicial Council.  The court shall advise the parent or guardian of any right to services and of the possible consequences of a waiver of services, including the termination of parental rights and placement of the child for adoption.  The court shall not accept the waiver of services unless it states on the record its finding that the parent or guardian has knowingly and intelligently waived the right to services.(14) That the parent or guardian has on one or more occasions willfully abducted the child or child’s sibling or half-sibling from his or her placement and refused to disclose the child’s or child’s sibling or half-sibling’s whereabouts, refused to return physical custody of the child or child’s sibling or half-sibling to his or her placement, or refused to return physical custody of the child or child’s sibling or half-sibling to the social worker.(c) In deciding whether to order reunification in any case in which this section applies, the court shall hold a dispositional hearing.  The social worker shall prepare a report that discusses whether reunification services shall be provided.  When it is alleged, pursuant to paragraph (2) of subdivision (b), that the parent is incapable of utilizing services due to mental disability, the court shall order reunification services unless competent evidence from mental health professionals establishes that, even with the provision of services, the parent is unlikely to be capable of adequately caring for the child within the time limits specified in subdivision (a).The court shall not order reunification for a parent or guardian described in paragraph (3), (4), (6), (7), (8), (9), (10), (11), (12), (13), or (14) of subdivision (b) unless the court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that reunification is in the best interest of the child.In addition, the court shall not order reunification in any situation described in paragraph (5) of subdivision (b) unless it finds that, based on competent testimony, those services are likely to prevent reabuse or continued neglect of the child or that failure to try reunification will be detrimental to the child because the child is closely and positively attached to that parent.  The social worker shall investigate the circumstances leading to the removal of the child and advise the court whether there are circumstances that indicate that reunification is likely to be successful or unsuccessful and whether failure to order reunification is likely to be detrimental to the child.The failure of the parent to respond to previous services, the fact that the child was abused while the parent was under the influence of drugs or alcohol, a past history of violent behavior, or testimony by a competent professional that the parent’s behavior is unlikely to be changed by services are among the factors indicating that reunification services are unlikely to be successful.  The fact that a parent or guardian is no longer living with an individual who severely abused the child may be considered in deciding that reunification services are likely to be successful, provided that the court shall consider any pattern of behavior on the part of the parent that has exposed the child to repeated abuse.(d) If reunification services are not ordered pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) and the whereabouts of a parent become known within six months of the out-of-home placement of the child, the court shall order the social worker to provide family reunification services in accordance with this subdivision.(e) (1) If the parent or guardian is incarcerated or institutionalized, the court shall order reasonable services unless the court determines, by clear and convincing evidence, those services would be detrimental to the child.  In determining detriment, the court shall consider the age of the child, the degree of parent-child bonding, the length of the sentence, the nature of the treatment, the nature of the crime or illness, the degree of detriment to the child if services are not offered and, for children 10 years of age or older, the child’s attitude toward the implementation of family reunification services, and any other appropriate factors.  Reunification services are subject to the applicable time limitations imposed in subdivision (a).  Services may include, but shall not be limited to, all of the following:(A) Maintaining contact between the parent and child through collect telephone calls.(B) Transportation services, where appropriate.(C) Visitation services, where appropriate.(D) Reasonable services to extended family members or foster parents providing care for the child if the services are not detrimental to the child.An incarcerated parent may be required to attend counseling, parenting classes, or vocational training programs as part of the service plan if these programs are available.(2) The presiding judge of the juvenile court of each county may convene representatives of the county welfare department, the sheriff’s department, and other appropriate entities for the purpose of developing and entering into protocols for ensuring the notification, transportation, and presence of an incarcerated or institutionalized parent at all court hearings involving proceedings affecting the child pursuant to Section 2625 of the Penal Code.(3) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if the incarcerated parent is a woman seeking to participate in the community treatment program operated by the Department of Corrections pursuant to Chapter 4.8 (commencing with Section 1174) of Title 7 of Part 2 of, Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 3410) of Title 2 of Part 3 of, the Penal Code, the court shall determine whether the parent’s participation in a program is in the child’s best interest and whether it is suitable to meet the needs of the parent and child.(f) If the court, pursuant to paragraph (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), (10), (11), (12), (13), or (14) of subdivision (b) or paragraph (1) of subdivision (e), does not order reunification services, it shall, at the dispositional hearing, that shall include a permanency hearing, determine if a hearing under Section 366.26 shall be set in order to determine whether adoption, guardianship, or long-term foster care is the most appropriate plan for the child.  If the court so determines, it shall conduct the hearing pursuant to Section 366.26 within 120 days after the dispositional hearing. However, the court shall not schedule a hearing so long as the other parent is being provided reunification services pursuant to subdivision (a).  The court may continue to permit the parent to visit the child unless it finds that visitation would be detrimental to the child.(g) Whenever a court orders that a hearing shall be held pursuant to Section 366.26, it shall direct the agency supervising the child and the licensed county adoption agency, or the State Department of Social Services when it is acting as an adoption agency in counties that are not served by a county adoption agency, to prepare an assessment that shall include:(1) Current search efforts for an absent parent or parents.(2) A review of the amount of and nature of any contact between the child and his or her parents and other members of his or her extended family since the time of placement.  Although the extended family of each child shall be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, “extended family” for the purpose of this paragraph shall include, but not be limited to, the child’s siblings, grandparents, aunts, and uncles.(3) An evaluation of the child’s medical, developmental, scholastic, mental, and emotional status.  The evaluation of the minor’s scholastic status shall include whether the child has been identified as having exceptional needs as described in Part 30 (commencing with Section 56000) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Education Code or disabilities justifying accommodations as described in Chapter 16 of Title 29 of the United States Code Annotated; and any information concerning whether the right of the parent or guardian to make educational decisions for the child has previously been limited by the court under Section 7579.5 of the Government Code; and whether the parent or guardian has previously designated an educational representative.(4) A preliminary assessment of the eligibility and commitment of any identified prospective adoptive parent or guardian, particularly the caretaker, to include a social history including screening for criminal records and prior referrals for child abuse or neglect, the capability to meet the child’s needs, and the understanding of the legal and financial rights and responsibilities of adoption and guardianship.  If a proposed guardian is a relative of the minor, and the relative was assessed for foster care placement of the minor prior to January 1, 1998, the assessment shall also consider, but need not be limited to, all of the factors specified in subdivision (a) of Section 361.3.  As used in this paragraph, “relative” means an adult who is related to the minor by blood, adoption, or affinity within the fifth degree of kinship, including stepparents, stepsiblings, and all relatives whose status is preceded by the words “great,” “great-great,” or “grand,” or the spouse of any of those persons even if the marriage was terminated by death or dissolution.(5) The relationship of the child to any identified prospective adoptive parent or guardian, the duration and character of the relationship, the motivation for seeking adoption or guardianship, and a statement from the child concerning placement and the adoption or guardianship, unless the child’s age or physical, emotional, or other condition precludes his or her meaningful response, and if so, a description of the condition.(6) An analysis of the likelihood that the child will be adopted if parental rights are terminated.(h) In determining whether reunification services will benefit the child pursuant to paragraph (6) or (7) of subdivision (b), the court shall consider any information it deems relevant, including the following factors:(1) The specific act or omission comprising the severe sexual abuse or the severe physical harm inflicted on the child or the child’s sibling or half-sibling.(2) The circumstances under which the abuse or harm was inflicted on the child or the child’s sibling or half-sibling.(3) The severity of the emotional trauma suffered by the child or the child’s sibling or half-sibling.(4) Any history of abuse of other children by the offending parent or guardian.(5) The likelihood that the child may be safely returned to the care of the offending parent or guardian within 12 months with no continuing supervision.(6) Whether or not the child desires to be reunified with the offending parent or guardian.(i) The court shall read into the record the basis for a finding of severe sexual abuse or the infliction of severe physical harm under paragraph (6) of subdivision (b), and shall also specify the factual findings used to determine that the provision of reunification services to the offending parent or guardian would not benefit the child.SEC. 11.2. Section 361.5 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:361.5. (a) Except as provided in subdivision (b) of this section or when the parent has voluntarily relinquished the child and the relinquishment has been filed with the State Department of Social Services, or upon the establishment of an order of guardianship pursuant to Section 360, whenever a child is removed from a parent’s or guardian’s custody, the juvenile court shall order the social worker to provide child welfare services to the child and the child’s mother and statutorily presumed father or guardians.  Upon a finding and declaration of paternity by the juvenile court or proof of a prior declaration of paternity by any court of competent jurisdiction, the juvenile court may order services for the child and the biological father, if the court determines that the services will benefit the child.  Child welfare services, when provided, shall be provided as follows:(1) For a child who, on the date of initial removal from the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian, was three years of age or older, court-ordered services shall not exceed a period of 12 months from the date the child entered foster care.(2) For a child who, on the date of initial removal from the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian, was under the age of three years, court-ordered services shall not exceed a period of six months from the date the child entered foster care.Regardless of the age of the child, a child shall be deemed to have entered foster care on the earlier of the date of the jurisdictional hearing held pursuant to Section 356 or the date that is 60 days after the date on which the child was initially removed from the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian.Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) and (2), court-ordered services may be extended up to a maximum time period not to exceed 18 months after the date the child was originally removed from physical custody of his or her parent or guardian if it can be shown, at the hearing held pursuant to subdivision (f) of Section 366.21, that the permanent plan for the child is that he or she will be returned and safely maintained in the home within the extended time period.  The court shall extend the time period only if it finds that there is a substantial probability that the child will be returned to the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian within the extended time period or that reasonable services have not been provided to the parent or guardian.  If the court extends the time period, the court shall specify the factual basis for its conclusion that there is a substantial probability that the child will be returned to the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian within the extended time period.  The court also shall make findings pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 366 and subdivision (e) of Section 358.1.When counseling or other treatment services are ordered, the parent or guardian shall be ordered to participate in those services, unless the parent’s or guardian’s participation is deemed by the court to be inappropriate or potentially detrimental to the child.  Physical custody of the child by the parents or guardians during the 12-month period shall not serve to interrupt the running of the period.  If at the end of the 12-month period, a child cannot be safely returned to the care and custody of a parent or guardian without court supervision, but the child clearly desires contact with the parent or guardian, the court shall take the child’s desire into account in devising a permanency plan.In cases where the child was under the age of three years on the date of the initial removal from the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian, the court shall inform the parent or guardian that the failure of the parent or guardian to participate regularly in any court-ordered treatment programs or to cooperate or avail himself or herself of services provided as part of the child welfare services case plan may result in a termination of efforts to reunify the family after six months.Except in cases where, pursuant to subdivision (b), the court does not order reunification services, the court shall inform the parent or parents of Section 366.26 and shall specify that the parent’s or parents’ parental rights may be terminated.(b) Reunification services need not be provided to a parent or guardian described in this subdivision when the court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, any of the following:(1) That the whereabouts of the parent or guardian is unknown.  A finding pursuant to this paragraph shall be supported by an affidavit or by proof that a reasonably diligent search has failed to locate the parent or guardian.  The posting or publication of notices is not required in that search.(2) That the parent or guardian is suffering from a mental disability that is described in Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 7820) of Part 4 of Division 12 of the Family Code and that renders him or her incapable of utilizing those services.(3) That the child or a sibling of the child has been previously adjudicated a dependent pursuant to any subdivision of Section 300 as a result of physical or sexual abuse, that following that adjudication the child had been removed from the custody of his or her parent or guardian pursuant to Section 361, that the child has been returned to the custody of the parent or guardian from whom the child had been taken originally, and that the child is being removed pursuant to Section 361, due to additional physical or sexual abuse.(4) That the parent or guardian of the child has caused the death of another child through abuse or neglect.(5) That the child was brought within the jurisdiction of the court under subdivision (e) of Section 300 because of the conduct of that parent or guardian.(6) That the child has been adjudicated a dependent pursuant to any subdivision of Section 300 as a result of severe sexual abuse or the infliction of severe physical harm to the child, a sibling, or a half-sibling by a parent or guardian, as defined in this subdivision, and the court makes a factual finding that it would not benefit the child to pursue reunification services with the offending parent or guardian.A finding of severe sexual abuse, for the purposes of this subdivision, may be based on, but is not limited to, sexual intercourse, or stimulation involving genital-genital, oral-genital, anal-genital, or oral-anal contact, whether between the parent or guardian and the child or a sibling or half-sibling of the child, or between the child or a sibling or half-sibling of the child and another person or animal with the actual or implied consent of the parent or guardian; or the penetration or manipulation of the child’s, sibling’s, or half-sibling’s genital organs or rectum by any animate or inanimate object for the sexual gratification of the parent or guardian, or for the sexual gratification of another person with the actual or implied consent of the parent or guardian.A finding of the infliction of severe physical harm, for the purposes of this subdivision, may be based on, but is not limited to, deliberate and serious injury inflicted to or on a child’s body or the body of a sibling or half-sibling of the child by an act or omission of the parent or guardian, or of another individual or animal with the consent of the parent or guardian; deliberate and torturous confinement of the child, sibling, or half-sibling in a closed space; or any other torturous act or omission that would be reasonably understood to cause serious emotional damage.(7) That the parent is not receiving reunification services for a sibling or a half-sibling of the child pursuant to paragraph (3), (5), or (6).(8) That the child was conceived by means of the commission of an offense listed in Section 288 or 288.5 of the Penal Code, or by an act committed outside of this state that, if committed in this state, would constitute one of those offenses.  This paragraph only applies to the parent who committed the offense or act.(9) That the child has been found to be a child described in subdivision (g) of Section 300, that the parent or guardian of the child willfully abandoned the child, and the court finds that the abandonment itself constituted a serious danger to the child.  For the purposes of this paragraph, “serious danger” means that without the intervention of another person or agency, the child would have sustained severe or permanent disability, injury, illness, or death.  For purposes of this paragraph, “willful abandonment” shall not be construed as actions taken in good faith by the parent without the intent of placing the child in serious danger.(10) That (A) the court ordered termination of reunification services for any siblings or half-siblings of the child because the parent or guardian failed to reunify with the sibling or half-sibling after the sibling or half-sibling had been removed from that parent or guardian pursuant to Section 361 and that parent or guardian is the same parent or guardian described in subdivision (a), or (B) the parental rights of a parent or guardian over any sibling or half-sibling of the child had been permanently severed, and that, according to the findings of the court, this parent or guardian has not subsequently made a reasonable effort to treat the problems that led to removal of the sibling or half-sibling of that child from that parent or guardian.(11) That the parent or guardian of the child has been convicted of a violent felony, as defined in subdivision (c) of Section 667.5 of the Penal Code.(12) That the parent or guardian of the child has a history of extensive, abusive, and chronic use of drugs or alcohol and has resisted prior treatment for this problem during a three-year period immediately prior to the filing of the petition that brought that child to the court’s attention, or has failed or refused to comply with a program of drug or alcohol treatment described in the case plan required by Section 358.1 on at least two prior occasions, even though the programs identified were available and accessible.(13) That the parent or guardian of the child has advised the court that he or she is not interested in receiving family maintenance or family reunification services or having the child returned to or placed in his or her custody and does not wish to receive family maintenance or reunification services.The parent or guardian shall be represented by counsel and shall execute a waiver of services form to be adopted by the Judicial Council.  The court shall advise the parent or guardian of any right to services and of the possible consequences of a waiver of services, including the termination of parental rights and placement of the child for adoption.  The court shall not accept the waiver of services unless it states on the record its finding that the parent or guardian has knowingly and intelligently waived the right to services.(14) That the parent or guardian has on one or more occasions willfully abducted the child or child’s sibling or half-sibling from his or her placement and refused to disclose the child’s or child’s sibling or half-sibling’s whereabouts, refused to return physical custody of the child or child’s sibling or half-sibling to his or her placement, or refused to return physical custody of the child or child’s sibling or half-sibling to the social worker.(c) In deciding whether to order reunification in any case in which this section applies, the court shall hold a dispositional hearing.  The social worker shall prepare a report that discusses whether reunification services shall be provided.  When it is alleged, pursuant to paragraph (2) of subdivision (b), that the parent is incapable of utilizing services due to mental disability, the court shall order reunification services unless competent evidence from mental health professionals establishes that, even with the provision of services, the parent is unlikely to be capable of adequately caring for the child within the time limits specified in subdivision (a).The court shall not order reunification for a parent or guardian described in paragraph (3), (4), (6), (7), (8), (9), (10), (11), (12), (13), or (14) of subdivision (b) unless the court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that reunification is in the best interest of the child.In addition, the court shall not order reunification in any situation described in paragraph (5) of subdivision (b) unless it finds that, based on competent testimony, those services are likely to prevent reabuse or continued neglect of the child or that failure to try reunification will be detrimental to the child because the child is closely and positively attached to that parent.  The social worker shall investigate the circumstances leading to the removal of the child and advise the court whether there are circumstances that indicate that reunification is likely to be successful or unsuccessful and whether failure to order reunification is likely to be detrimental to the child.The failure of the parent to respond to previous services, the fact that the child was abused while the parent was under the influence of drugs or alcohol, a past history of violent behavior, or testimony by a competent professional that the parent’s behavior is unlikely to be changed by services are among the factors indicating that reunification services are unlikely to be successful.  The fact that a parent or guardian is no longer living with an individual who severely abused the child may be considered in deciding that reunification services are likely to be successful, provided that the court shall consider any pattern of behavior on the part of the parent that has exposed the child to repeated abuse.(d) If reunification services are not ordered pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) and the whereabouts of a parent become known within six months of the out-of-home placement of the child, the court shall order the social worker to provide family reunification services in accordance with this subdivision.(e) (1) If the parent or guardian is incarcerated or institutionalized, the court shall order reasonable services unless the court determines, by clear and convincing evidence, those services would be detrimental to the child.  In determining detriment, the court shall consider the age of the child, the degree of parent-child bonding, the length of the sentence, the nature of the treatment, the nature of the crime or illness, the degree of detriment to the child if services are not offered and, for children 10 years of age or older, the child’s attitude toward the implementation of family reunification services, and any other appropriate factors.  Reunification services are subject to the 12-month limitation imposed in subdivision (a).  Services may include, but shall not be limited to, all of the following:(A) Maintaining contact between the parent and child through collect telephone calls.(B) Transportation services, where appropriate.(C) Visitation services, where appropriate.(D) Reasonable services to extended family members or foster parents providing care for the child if the services are not detrimental to the child.An incarcerated parent may be required to attend counseling, parenting classes, or vocational training programs as part of the service plan if these programs are available.(2) The presiding judge of the juvenile court of each county may convene representatives of the county welfare department, the sheriff’s department, and other appropriate entities for the purpose of developing and entering into protocols for ensuring the notification, transportation, and presence of an incarcerated or institutionalized parent at all court hearings involving proceedings affecting the child pursuant to Section 2625 of the Penal Code.(3) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if the incarcerated parent is a woman seeking to participate in the community treatment program operated by the Department of Corrections pursuant to Chapter 4.8 (commencing with Section 1174) of Title 7 of Part 2 of, Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 3410) of Title 2 of Part 3 of, the Penal Code, the court shall determine whether the parent’s participation in a program is in the child’s best interest and whether it is suitable to meet the needs of the parent and child.(f) If the court, pursuant to paragraph (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), (10), (11), (12), (13), or (14) of subdivision (b) or paragraph (1) of subdivision (e), does not order reunification services, it shall, at the dispositional hearing, that shall include a permanency hearing, determine if a hearing under Section 366.26 shall be set in order to determine whether adoption, guardianship, or long-term foster care is the most appropriate plan for the child.  If the court so determines, it shall conduct the hearing pursuant to Section 366.26 within 120 days after the dispositional hearing. However, the court shall not schedule a hearing so long as the other parent is being provided reunification services pursuant to subdivision (a).  The court may continue to permit the parent to visit the child unless it finds that visitation would be detrimental to the child.(g) Whenever a court orders that a hearing shall be held pursuant to Section 366.26, it shall direct the agency supervising the child and the licensed county adoption agency, or the State Department of Social Services when it is acting as an adoption agency in counties that are not served by a county adoption agency, to prepare an assessment that shall include:(1) Current search efforts for an absent parent or parents.(2) A review of the amount of and nature of any contact between the child and his or her parents and other members of his or her extended family since the time of placement.  Although the extended family of each child shall be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, “extended family” for the purpose of this paragraph shall include, but not be limited to, the child’s siblings, grandparents, aunts, and uncles.(3) An evaluation of the child’s medical, developmental, scholastic, mental, and emotional status.  The evaluation of the minor’s scholastic status shall include whether the child has been identified as having exceptional needs as described in Part 30 (commencing with Section 56000) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Education Code or disabilities justifying accommodations as described in Chapter 16 of Title 29 of the United States Code Annotated; and any information concerning whether the right of the parent or guardian to make educational decisions for the child has previously been limited by the court under Section 7579.5 of the Government Code; and whether the parent or guardian has previously designated an educational representative.(4) A preliminary assessment of the eligibility and commitment of any identified prospective adoptive parent or guardian, particularly the caretaker, to include a social history including screening for criminal records and prior referrals for child abuse or neglect, the capability to meet the child’s needs, and the understanding of the legal and financial rights and responsibilities of adoption and guardianship.  If a proposed guardian is a relative of the minor, and the relative was assessed for foster care placement of the minor prior to January 1, 1998, the assessment shall also consider, but need not be limited to, all of the factors specified in subdivision (a) of Section 361.3.  As used in this paragraph, “relative” means an adult who is related to the minor by blood, adoption, or affinity within the fifth degree of kinship, including stepparents, stepsiblings, and all relatives whose status is preceded by the words “great,” “great-great,” or “grand,” or the spouse of any of those persons even if the marriage was terminated by death or dissolution.(5) The relationship of the child to any identified prospective adoptive parent or guardian, the duration and character of the relationship, the motivation for seeking adoption or guardianship, and a statement from the child concerning placement and the adoption or guardianship, unless the child’s age or physical, emotional, or other condition precludes his or her meaningful response, and if so, a description of the condition.(6) An analysis of the likelihood that the child will be adopted if parental rights are terminated.(h) In determining whether reunification services will benefit the child pursuant to paragraph (6) or (7) of subdivision (b), the court shall consider any information it deems relevant, including the following factors:(1) The specific act or omission comprising the severe sexual abuse or the severe physical harm inflicted on the child or the child’s sibling or half-sibling.(2) The circumstances under which the abuse or harm was inflicted on the child or the child’s sibling or half-sibling.(3) The severity of the emotional trauma suffered by the child or the child’s sibling or half-sibling.(4) Any history of abuse of other children by the offending parent or guardian.(5) The likelihood that the child may be safely returned to the care of the offending parent or guardian within 12 months with no continuing supervision.(6) Whether or not the child desires to be reunified with the offending parent or guardian.(i) The court shall read into the record the basis for a finding of severe sexual abuse or the infliction of severe physical harm under paragraph (6) of subdivision (b), and shall also specify the factual findings used to determine that the provision of reunification services to the offending parent or guardian would not benefit the child.SEC. 11.3. Section 361.5 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:361.5. (a) Except as provided in subdivision (b) of this section or when the parent has voluntarily relinquished the child and the relinquishment has been filed with the State Department of Social Services, or upon the establishment of an order of guardianship pursuant to Section 360, whenever a child is removed from a parent’s or guardian’s custody, the juvenile court shall order the social worker to provide child welfare services to the child and the child’s mother and statutorily presumed father or guardians.  Upon a finding and declaration of paternity by the juvenile court or proof of a prior declaration of paternity by any court of competent jurisdiction, the juvenile court may order services for the child and the biological father, if the court determines that the services will benefit the child.  Child welfare services, when provided, shall be provided as follows:(1) For a child who, on the date of initial removal from the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian, was three years of age or older, court-ordered services shall not exceed a period of 12 months from the date the child entered foster care, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (3).(2) For a child who, on the date of initial removal from the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian, was under the age of three years, court-ordered services shall not exceed a period of six months from the date the child entered foster care.(3) For the purpose of placing and maintaining a sibling group together in a permanent home should reunification efforts fail, for a child in a sibling group whose members were removed from parental custody at the same time, and in which one member of the sibling group was under the age of three years on the date of initial removal from the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian, court-ordered services to some or all of the sibling group may be limited to a period of six months from the date the child entered foster care.  For the purposes of this paragraph, “a sibling group” shall mean two or more children who are related to each other as full or half-siblings.Regardless of the age of the child, a child shall be deemed to have entered foster care on the earlier of the date of the jurisdictional hearing held pursuant to Section 356 or the date that is 60 days after the date on which the child was initially removed from the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian.Notwithstanding paragraphs (1), (2), and (3), court-ordered services may be extended up to a maximum time period not to exceed 18 months after the date the child was originally removed from physical custody of his or her parent or guardian if it can be shown, at the hearing held pursuant to subdivision (f) of Section 366.21, that the permanent plan for the child is that he or she will be returned and safely maintained in the home within the extended time period.  The court shall extend the time period only if it finds that there is a substantial probability that the child will be returned to the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian within the extended time period or that reasonable services have not been provided to the parent or guardian.  If the court extends the time period, the court shall specify the factual basis for its conclusion that there is a substantial probability that the child will be returned to the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian within the extended time period.  The court also shall make findings pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 366 and subdivision (e) of Section 358.1.When counseling or other treatment services are ordered, the parent or guardian shall be ordered to participate in those services, unless the parent’s or guardian’s participation is deemed by the court to be inappropriate or potentially detrimental to the child.  Physical custody of the child by the parents or guardians during the applicable time period under paragraph (1), (2), or (3) shall not serve to interrupt the running of the period.  If at the end of the applicable time period, a child cannot be safely returned to the care and custody of a parent or guardian without court supervision, but the child clearly desires contact with the parent or guardian, the court shall take the child’s desire into account in devising a permanency plan.In cases where the child was under the age of three years on the date of the initial removal from the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian or is a member of a sibling group as described in paragraph (3), the court shall inform the parent or guardian that the failure of the parent or guardian to participate regularly in any court-ordered treatment programs or to cooperate or avail himself or herself of services provided as part of the child welfare services case plan may result in a termination of efforts to reunify the family after six months.  The court shall inform the parent or guardian of the factors used in subdivision (e) of Section 366.21 to determine whether to limit services to six months for some or all members of a sibling group as described in paragraph (3).Except in cases where, pursuant to subdivision (b), the court does not order reunification services, the court shall inform the parent or parents of Section 366.26 and shall specify that the parent’s or parents’ parental rights may be terminated.(b) Reunification services need not be provided to a parent or guardian described in this subdivision when the court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, any of the following:(1) That the whereabouts of the parent or guardian is unknown.  A finding pursuant to this paragraph shall be supported by an affidavit or by proof that a reasonably diligent search has failed to locate the parent or guardian.  The posting or publication of notices is not required in that search.(2) That the parent or guardian is suffering from a mental disability that is described in Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 7820) of Part 4 of Division 12 of the Family Code and that renders him or her incapable of utilizing those services.(3) That the child or a sibling of the child has been previously adjudicated a dependent pursuant to any subdivision of Section 300 as a result of physical or sexual abuse, that following that adjudication the child had been removed from the custody of his or her parent or guardian pursuant to Section 361, that the child has been returned to the custody of the parent or guardian from whom the child had been taken originally, and that the child is being removed pursuant to Section 361, due to additional physical or sexual abuse.(4) That the parent or guardian of the child has caused the death of another child through abuse or neglect.(5) That the child was brought within the jurisdiction of the court under subdivision (e) of Section 300 because of the conduct of that parent or guardian.(6) That the child has been adjudicated a dependent pursuant to any subdivision of Section 300 as a result of severe sexual abuse or the infliction of severe physical harm to the child, a sibling, or a half-sibling by a parent or guardian, as defined in this subdivision, and the court makes a factual finding that it would not benefit the child to pursue reunification services with the offending parent or guardian.A finding of severe sexual abuse, for the purposes of this subdivision, may be based on, but is not limited to, sexual intercourse, or stimulation involving genital-genital, oral-genital, anal-genital, or oral-anal contact, whether between the parent or guardian and the child or a sibling or half-sibling of the child, or between the child or a sibling or half-sibling of the child and another person or animal with the actual or implied consent of the parent or guardian; or the penetration or manipulation of the child’s, sibling’s, or half-sibling’s genital organs or rectum by any animate or inanimate object for the sexual gratification of the parent or guardian, or for the sexual gratification of another person with the actual or implied consent of the parent or guardian.A finding of the infliction of severe physical harm, for the purposes of this subdivision, may be based on, but is not limited to, deliberate and serious injury inflicted to or on a child’s body or the body of a sibling or half-sibling of the child by an act or omission of the parent or guardian, or of another individual or animal with the consent of the parent or guardian; deliberate and torturous confinement of the child, sibling, or half-sibling in a closed space; or any other torturous act or omission that would be reasonably understood to cause serious emotional damage.(7) That the parent is not receiving reunification services for a sibling or a half-sibling of the child pursuant to paragraph (3), (5), or (6).(8) That the child was conceived by means of the commission of an offense listed in Section 288 or 288.5 of the Penal Code, or by an act committed outside of this state that, if committed in this state, would constitute one of those offenses.  This paragraph only applies to the parent who committed the offense or act.(9) That the child has been found to be a child described in subdivision (g) of Section 300, that the parent or guardian of the child willfully abandoned the child, and the court finds that the abandonment itself constituted a serious danger to the child.  For the purposes of this paragraph, “serious danger” means that without the intervention of another person or agency, the child would have sustained severe or permanent disability, injury, illness, or death.  For purposes of this paragraph, “willful abandonment” shall not be construed as actions taken in good faith by the parent without the intent of placing the child in serious danger.(10) That (A) the court ordered termination of reunification services for any siblings or half-siblings of the child because the parent or guardian failed to reunify with the sibling or half-sibling after the sibling or half-sibling had been removed from that parent or guardian pursuant to Section 361 and that parent or guardian is the same parent or guardian described in subdivision (a), or (B) the parental rights of a parent or guardian over any sibling or half-sibling of the child had been permanently severed, and that, according to the findings of the court, this parent or guardian has not subsequently made a reasonable effort to treat the problems that led to removal of the sibling or half-sibling of that child from that parent or guardian.(11) That the parent or guardian of the child has been convicted of a violent felony, as defined in subdivision (c) of Section 667.5 of the Penal Code.(12) That the parent or guardian of the child has a history of extensive, abusive, and chronic use of drugs or alcohol and has resisted prior treatment for this problem during a three-year period immediately prior to the filing of the petition that brought that child to the court’s attention, or has failed or refused to comply with a program of drug or alcohol treatment described in the case plan required by Section 358.1 on at least two prior occasions, even though the programs identified were available and accessible.(13) That the parent or guardian of the child has advised the court that he or she is not interested in receiving family maintenance or family reunification services or having the child returned to or placed in his or her custody and does not wish to receive family maintenance or reunification services.The parent or guardian shall be represented by counsel and shall execute a waiver of services form to be adopted by the Judicial Council.  The court shall advise the parent or guardian of any right to services and of the possible consequences of a waiver of services, including the termination of parental rights and placement of the child for adoption.  The court shall not accept the waiver of services unless it states on the record its finding that the parent or guardian has knowingly and intelligently waived the right to services.(14) That the parent or guardian has on one or more occasions willfully abducted the child or child’s sibling or half-sibling from his or her placement and refused to disclose the child’s or child’s sibling or half-sibling’s whereabouts, refused to return physical custody of the child or child’s sibling or half-sibling to his or her placement, or refused to return physical custody of the child or child’s sibling or half-sibling to the social worker.(c) In deciding whether to order reunification in any case in which this section applies, the court shall hold a dispositional hearing.  The social worker shall prepare a report that discusses whether reunification services shall be provided.  When it is alleged, pursuant to paragraph (2) of subdivision (b), that the parent is incapable of utilizing services due to mental disability, the court shall order reunification services unless competent evidence from mental health professionals establishes that, even with the provision of services, the parent is unlikely to be capable of adequately caring for the child within the time limits specified in subdivision (a).The court shall not order reunification for a parent or guardian described in paragraph (3), (4), (6), (7), (8), (9), (10), (11), (12), (13), or (14) of subdivision (b) unless the court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that reunification is in the best interest of the child.In addition, the court shall not order reunification in any situation described in paragraph (5) of subdivision (b) unless it finds that, based on competent testimony, those services are likely to prevent reabuse or continued neglect of the child or that failure to try reunification will be detrimental to the child because the child is closely and positively attached to that parent.  The social worker shall investigate the circumstances leading to the removal of the child and advise the court whether there are circumstances that indicate that reunification is likely to be successful or unsuccessful and whether failure to order reunification is likely to be detrimental to the child.The failure of the parent to respond to previous services, the fact that the child was abused while the parent was under the influence of drugs or alcohol, a past history of violent behavior, or testimony by a competent professional that the parent’s behavior is unlikely to be changed by services are among the factors indicating that reunification services are unlikely to be successful.  The fact that a parent or guardian is no longer living with an individual who severely abused the child may be considered in deciding that reunification services are likely to be successful, provided that the court shall consider any pattern of behavior on the part of the parent that has exposed the child to repeated abuse.(d) If reunification services are not ordered pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) and the whereabouts of a parent become known within six months of the out-of-home placement of the child, the court shall order the social worker to provide family reunification services in accordance with this subdivision.(e) (1) If the parent or guardian is incarcerated or institutionalized, the court shall order reasonable services unless the court determines, by clear and convincing evidence, those services would be detrimental to the child.  In determining detriment, the court shall consider the age of the child, the degree of parent-child bonding, the length of the sentence, the nature of the treatment, the nature of the crime or illness, the degree of detriment to the child if services are not offered and, for children 10 years of age or older, the child’s attitude toward the implementation of family reunification services, and any other appropriate factors.  Reunification services are subject to the applicable time limitations imposed in subdivision (a).  Services may include, but shall not be limited to, all of the following:(A) Maintaining contact between the parent and child through collect telephone calls.(B) Transportation services, where appropriate.(C) Visitation services, where appropriate.(D) Reasonable services to extended family members or foster parents providing care for the child if the services are not detrimental to the child.An incarcerated parent may be required to attend counseling, parenting classes, or vocational training programs as part of the service plan if these programs are available.(2) The presiding judge of the juvenile court of each county may convene representatives of the county welfare department, the sheriff’s department, and other appropriate entities for the purpose of developing and entering into protocols for ensuring the notification, transportation, and presence of an incarcerated or institutionalized parent at all court hearings involving proceedings affecting the child pursuant to Section 2625 of the Penal Code.(3) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if the incarcerated parent is a woman seeking to participate in the community treatment program operated by the Department of Corrections pursuant to Chapter 4.8 (commencing with Section 1174) of Title 7 of Part 2 of, Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 3410) of Title 2 of Part 3 of, the Penal Code, the court shall determine whether the parent’s participation in a program is in the child’s best interest and whether it is suitable to meet the needs of the parent and child.(f) If the court, pursuant to paragraph (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), (10), (11), (12), (13), or (14) of subdivision (b) or paragraph (1) of subdivision (e), does not order reunification services, it shall, at the dispositional hearing, that shall include a permanency hearing, determine if a hearing under Section 366.26 shall be set in order to determine whether adoption, guardianship, or long-term foster care is the most appropriate plan for the child.  If the court so determines, it shall conduct the hearing pursuant to Section 366.26 within 120 days after the dispositional hearing. However, the court shall not schedule a hearing so long as the other parent is being provided reunification services pursuant to subdivision (a).  The court may continue to permit the parent to visit the child unless it finds that visitation would be detrimental to the child.(g) Whenever a court orders that a hearing shall be held pursuant to Section 366.26, it shall direct the agency supervising the child and the licensed county adoption agency, or the State Department of Social Services when it is acting as an adoption agency in counties that are not served by a county adoption agency, to prepare an assessment that shall include:(1) Current search efforts for an absent parent or parents.(2) A review of the amount of and nature of any contact between the child and his or her parents and other members of his or her extended family since the time of placement.  Although the extended family of each child shall be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, “extended family” for the purpose of this paragraph shall include, but not be limited to, the child’s siblings, grandparents, aunts, and uncles.(3) An evaluation of the child’s medical, developmental, scholastic, mental, and emotional status.  The evaluation of the minor’s scholastic status shall include whether the child has been identified as having exceptional needs as described in Part 30 (commencing with Section 56000) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Education Code or disabilities justifying accommodations as described in Chapter 16 of Title 29 of the United States Code Annotated; and any information concerning whether the right of the parent or guardian to make educational decisions for the child has previously been limited by the court under Section 7579.5 of the Government Code; and whether the parent or guardian has previously designated an educational representative.(4) A preliminary assessment of the eligibility and commitment of any identified prospective adoptive parent or guardian, particularly the caretaker, to include a social history including screening for criminal records and prior referrals for child abuse or neglect, the capability to meet the child’s needs, and the understanding of the legal and financial rights and responsibilities of adoption and guardianship.  If a proposed guardian is a relative of the minor, and the relative was assessed for foster care placement of the minor prior to January 1, 1998, the assessment shall also consider, but need not be limited to, all of the factors specified in subdivision (a) of Section 361.3.  As used in this paragraph, “relative” means an adult who is related to the minor by blood, adoption, or affinity within the fifth degree of kinship, including stepparents, stepsiblings, and all relatives whose status is preceded by the words “great,” “great-great,” or “grand,” or the spouse of any of those persons even if the marriage was terminated by death or dissolution.(5) The relationship of the child to any identified prospective adoptive parent or guardian, the duration and character of the relationship, the motivation for seeking adoption or guardianship, and a statement from the child concerning placement and the adoption or guardianship, unless the child’s age or physical, emotional, or other condition precludes his or her meaningful response, and if so, a description of the condition.(6) An analysis of the likelihood that the child will be adopted if parental rights are terminated.(h) In determining whether reunification services will benefit the child pursuant to paragraph (6) or (7) of subdivision (b), the court shall consider any information it deems relevant, including the following factors:(1) The specific act or omission comprising the severe sexual abuse or the severe physical harm inflicted on the child or the child’s sibling or half-sibling.(2) The circumstances under which the abuse or harm was inflicted on the child or the child’s sibling or half-sibling.(3) The severity of the emotional trauma suffered by the child or the child’s sibling or half-sibling.(4) Any history of abuse of other children by the offending parent or guardian.(5) The likelihood that the child may be safely returned to the care of the offending parent or guardian within 12 months with no continuing supervision.(6) Whether or not the child desires to be reunified with the offending parent or guardian.(i) The court shall read into the record the basis for a finding of severe sexual abuse or the infliction of severe physical harm under paragraph (6) of subdivision (b), and shall also specify the factual findings used to determine that the provision of reunification services to the offending parent or guardian would not benefit the child.SEC. 12. Section 366.21 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:366.21. (a) Every hearing conducted by the juvenile court reviewing the status of a dependent child shall be placed on the appearance calendar. The court shall advise all persons present at the hearing of the date of the future hearing and of their right to be present and represented by counsel.(b) Except as provided in Section 366.23 and subdivision (a) of Section 366.3, notice of the hearing shall be mailed by the social worker to the same persons as in the original proceeding, to the child’s parent or guardian, to the foster parents, relative caregivers, community care facility, or foster family agency having physical custody of the child in the case of a child removed from the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian, and to the counsel of record if the counsel of record was not present at the time that the hearing was set by the court, by first-class mail addressed to the last known address of the person to be notified, or shall be personally served on those persons, not earlier than 30 days nor later than 15 days preceding the date to which the hearing was continued.  Service of a copy of the notice personally or by certified mail return receipt requested, or any other form of actual notice is equivalent to service by first-class mail.The notice shall contain a statement regarding the nature of the hearing to be held and any change in the custody or status of the child being recommended by the supervising agency.  The notice to the foster parent, relative caregiver, or a certified foster parent who has been approved for adoption by the State Department of Social Services when it is acting as an adoption agency or by a licensed adoption agency shall indicate that the foster parent, relative caregiver, or a certified foster parent who has been approved for adoption by the State Department of Social Services when it is acting as an adoption agency or by a licensed adoption agency may attend all hearings or may submit any information he or she deems relevant to the court in writing.(c) At least 10 calendar days prior to the hearing the social worker shall file a supplemental report with the court regarding the services provided or offered to the parent or guardian to enable him or her to assume custody and the efforts made to achieve legal permanence for the child if efforts to reunify fail, the progress made, and, where relevant, the prognosis for return of the child to the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian, and make his or her recommendation for disposition.  If the recommendation is not to return the child to a parent or guardian, the report shall specify why the return of the child would be detrimental to the child. The social worker shall provide the parent or guardian with a copy of the report, including his or her recommendation for disposition, at least 10 calendar days prior to the hearing.  In the case of a child removed from the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian, the social worker shall provide a summary of his or her recommendation for disposition to the counsel for the child, any court-appointed child advocate, foster parents, relative caregivers, certified foster parents who have been approved for adoption by the State Department of Social Services when it is acting as an adoption agency or by a licensed adoption agency, community care facility, or foster family agency having the physical custody of the child at least 10 calendar days before the hearing.(d) Prior to any hearing involving a child in the physical custody of a community care facility or foster family agency that may result in the return of the child to the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian, or in adoption or the creation of a legal guardianship, the facility or agency shall file with the court a report containing its recommendation for disposition.  Prior to the hearing involving a child in the physical custody of a foster parent, a relative caregiver, or a certified foster parent who has been approved for adoption by the State Department of Social Services when it is acting as an adoption agency or by a licensed adoption agency, the foster parent, relative caregiver, or the certified foster parent who has been approved for adoption by the State Department of Social Services when it is acting as an adoption agency or by a licensed adoption agency, may file with the court a report containing his or her recommendation for disposition.  The court shall consider the report and recommendation filed pursuant to this subdivision prior to determining any disposition.(e) At the review hearing held six months after the initial dispositional hearing, the court shall order the return of the child to the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian unless the court finds, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the return of the child to his or her parent or guardian would create a substantial risk of detriment to the safety, protection, or physical or emotional well-being of the child.  The social worker shall have the burden of establishing that detriment.  The failure of the parent or guardian to participate regularly in court-ordered treatment programs shall be prima facie evidence that return would be detrimental.  In making its determination, the court shall review and consider the social worker’s report and recommendations and the report and recommendations of any child advocate appointed pursuant to Section 356.5; and shall consider the efforts or progress, or both, demonstrated by the parent or guardian and the extent to which he or she availed himself or herself of services provided.Evidence of any or all of the following circumstances shall not, in and of themselves, be deemed a failure to provide or offer reasonable services:(1) The child has been placed with a foster family that is eligible to adopt a child, or has been placed in a preadoptive home.(2) The case plan includes services to achieve legal permanence for the child if efforts to reunify fail.(3) Services to achieve legal permanence for the child, if efforts to reunify fail, are provided concurrently with services to reunify the family.Whether or not the child is returned to a parent or guardian, the court shall specify the factual basis for its conclusion that the return would be detrimental or would not be detrimental.  The court also shall make appropriate findings pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 366; and where relevant, shall order any additional services reasonably believed to facilitate the return of the child to the custody of his or her parent or guardian.  The court shall also inform the parent or guardian that if the child cannot be returned home by the 12-month permanency hearing, a proceeding pursuant to Section 366.26 may be instituted.  This section does not apply in a case where, pursuant to Section 361.5, the court has ordered that reunification services shall not be provided.If the child was under the age of three years on the date of the initial removal and the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the parent failed to participate regularly in any court-ordered treatment plan, the court may schedule a hearing pursuant to Section 366.26 within 120 days.  If, however, the court finds there is a substantial probability that the child, who was under the age of three years on the date of initial removal, may be returned to his or her parent or guardian within six months or that reasonable services have not been provided, the court shall continue the case to the 12-month permanency hearing.If the child was removed initially under subdivision (g) of Section 300 and the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the whereabouts of the parent are still unknown, or the parent has failed to contact and visit the child, the court may schedule a hearing pursuant to Section 366.26 within 120 days.  If the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the parent has been convicted of a felony indicating parental unfitness, the court may schedule a hearing pursuant to Section 366.26 within 120 days.If the child had been placed under court supervision with a previously noncustodial parent pursuant to Section 361.2, the court shall determine whether supervision is still necessary.  The court may terminate supervision and transfer permanent custody to that parent, as provided for by paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 361.2.In all other cases, the court shall direct that any reunification services previously ordered shall continue to be offered to the parent or guardian pursuant to the time periods set forth in subdivision (a) of Section 361.5, provided that the court may modify the terms and conditions of those services.If the child is not returned to his or her parent or guardian, the court shall determine whether reasonable services have been provided or offered to the parent or guardian which were designed to aid the parent or guardian in overcoming the problems which led to the initial removal and the continued custody of the child.  The court shall order that those services be initiated, continued, or terminated.(f) The permanency hearing shall be held no later than 12 months after the date the child entered foster care, as that date is determined pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 361.5.  At the permanency hearing, the court shall determine the permanent plan for the child, that shall include a determination of whether the child will be returned to the child’s home and, if so, when, within the time limits of subdivision (a) of Section 361.5.  The court shall order the return of the child to the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian unless the court finds, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the return of the child to his or her parent or guardian would create a substantial risk of detriment to the safety, protection, or physical or emotional well-being of the child.  The social worker shall have the burden of establishing that detriment.  The court shall also determine whether reasonable services have been provided or offered to the parent or guardian that were designed to aid the parent or guardian to overcome the problems that led to the initial removal and continued custody of the child.  The failure of the parent or guardian to participate regularly in court-ordered treatment programs shall be prima facie evidence that return would be detrimental.  In making its determination, the court shall review and consider the social worker’s report and recommendations and the report and recommendations of any child advocate appointed pursuant to Section 356.5; shall consider the efforts or progress, or both, demonstrated by the parent or guardian and the extent to which he or she availed himself or herself of services provided; and shall make appropriate findings pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 366.Evidence of any or all of the following circumstances shall not, in and of themselves, be deemed a failure to provide or offer reasonable services:(1) The child has been placed with a foster family that is eligible to adopt a child, or has been placed in a preadoptive home.(2) The case plan includes services to achieve legal permanence for the child if efforts to reunify fail.(3) Services to achieve legal permanence for the child, if efforts to reunify fail, are provided concurrently with services to reunify the family.Whether or not the child is returned to his or her parent or guardian, the court shall specify the factual basis for its decision.  If the child is not returned to a parent or guardian, the court shall specify the factual basis for its conclusion that the return would be detrimental.  The court also shall make a finding pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 366.(g) If the time period in which the court-ordered services were provided has met or exceeded the time period set forth in paragraph (1) or (2) of subdivision (a) of Section 361.5, as appropriate, and a child is not returned to the custody of a parent or guardian at the permanency hearing held pursuant to subdivision (f), the court shall do one of the following:(1) Continue the case for up to six months for a permanency review hearing, provided that the hearing shall occur within 18 months of the date the child was originally taken from the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian.  The court shall continue the case only if it finds that there is a substantial probability that the child will be returned to the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian and safely maintained in the home within the extended period of time or that reasonable services have not been provided to the parent or guardian.  For the purposes of this section, in order to find a substantial probability that the child will be returned to the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian and safely maintained in the home within the extended period of time, the court shall be required to find all of the following:(A) That the parent or guardian has consistently and regularly contacted and visited with the child.(B) That the parent or guardian has made significant progress in resolving problems that led to the child’s removal from the home.(C) The parent or guardian has demonstrated the capacity and ability both to complete the objectives of his or her treatment plan and to provide for the child’s safety, protection, physical and emotional well-being, and special needs.The court shall inform the parent or guardian that if the child cannot be returned home by the next permanency review hearing, a proceeding pursuant to Section 366.36 may be instituted.  The court shall not order that a hearing pursuant to Section 366.26 be held unless there is clear and convincing evidence that reasonable services have been provided or offered to the parent or guardian.(2) Order that the child remain in long-term foster care, but only if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence, based upon the evidence already presented to it, including a recommendation by the State Department of Social Services when it is acting as an adoption agency or by a licensed adoption agency, that there is a compelling reason for determining that a hearing held pursuant to Section 366.26 is not in the best interest of the child because the child is not a proper subject for adoption and has no one willing to accept legal guardianship.  For purposes of this section, a recommendation by the State Department of Social Services when it is acting as an adoption agency or by a licensed adoption agency that adoption is not in the best interest of the child shall constitute a compelling reason for the court’s determination.  That recommendation shall be based on the present circumstances of the child and shall not preclude a different recommendation at a later date if the child’s circumstances change.(3) Order that a hearing be held within 120 days, pursuant to Section 366.26, if there is clear and convincing evidence that reasonable services have been provided or offered to the parents.Evidence of any or all of the following circumstances shall not, in and of themselves, be deemed a failure to provide or offer reasonable services:(A) The child has been placed with a foster family that is eligible to adopt a child, or has been placed in a preadoptive home.(B) The case plan includes services to achieve legal permanence for the child if efforts to reunify fail.(C) Services to achieve legal permanence for the child, if efforts to reunify fail, are provided concurrently with services to reunify the family.(h) In any case in which the court orders that a hearing pursuant to Section 366.26 shall be held, it shall also order the termination of reunification services to the parent.  The court shall continue to permit the parent to visit the child pending the hearing unless it finds that visitation would be detrimental to the child.(i) Whenever a court orders that a hearing pursuant to Section 366.26 shall be held, it shall direct the agency supervising the child and the licensed county adoption agency, or the State Department of Social Services when it is acting as an adoption agency in counties that are not served by a county adoption agency, to prepare an assessment that shall include:(1) Current search efforts for an absent parent or parents.(2) A review of the amount of and nature of any contact between the child and his or her parents and other members of his or her extended family since the time of placement.  Although the extended family of each child shall be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, “extended family” for the purpose of this paragraph shall include, but not be limited to, the child’s siblings, grandparents, aunts, and uncles.(3) An evaluation of the child’s medical, developmental, scholastic, mental, and emotional status.  The evaluation of the minor’s scholastic status shall include whether the child has been identified as having exceptional needs as described in Part 30 (commencing with Section 56000) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Education Code or disabilities justifying accommodations as described in Chapter 16 of Title 29 of the United States Code Annotated; and any information concerning whether the right of the parent or guardian to make educational decisions for the child has previously been limited by the court under Section 7579.5 of the Government Code; and whether the parent or guardian has previously designated and educational representative.(4) A preliminary assessment of the eligibility and commitment of any identified prospective adoptive parent or guardian, particularly the caretaker, to include a social history including screening for criminal records and prior referrals for child abuse or neglect, the capability to meet the child’s needs, and the understanding of the legal and financial rights and responsibilities of adoption and guardianship.  If a proposed guardian is a relative of the minor, and the relative was assessed for foster care placement of the minor prior to January 1, 1998, the assessment shall also consider, but need not be limited to, all of the factors specified in subdivision (a) of Section 361.3.(5) The relationship of the child to any identified prospective adoptive parent or guardian, the duration and character of the relationship, the motivation for seeking adoption or guardianship, and a statement from the child concerning placement and the adoption or guardianship, unless the child’s age or physical, emotional, or other condition precludes his or her meaningful response, and if so, a description of the condition.(6) An analysis of the likelihood that the child will be adopted if parental rights are terminated.(j) If, at any hearing held pursuant to Section 366.26, a guardianship is established for the minor with a relative, the relative shall be eligible for aid under the Kin-GAP program as provided in Article 4.5 (commencing with Section 11360) of Chapter 2 of Part 3 of Division 9.(k) As used in this section, “relative” means an adult who is related to the minor by blood, adoption, or affinity within the fifth degree of kinship, including stepparents, stepsiblings, and all relatives whose status is preceded by the words “great,” “great-great,” or “grand,” or the spouse of any of those persons even if the marriage was terminated by death or dissolution.SEC. 12.1. Section 366.21 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:366.21. (a) Every hearing conducted by the juvenile court reviewing the status of a dependent child shall be placed on the appearance calendar. The court shall advise all persons present at the hearing of the date of the future hearing and of their right to be present and represented by counsel.(b) Except as provided in Section 366.23 and subdivision (a) of Section 366.3, notice of the hearing shall be mailed by the social worker to the same persons as in the original proceeding, to the child’s parent or guardian, to the foster parents, relative caregivers, community care facility, or foster family agency having physical custody of the child in the case of a child removed from the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian, and to the counsel of record if the counsel of record was not present at the time that the hearing was set by the court, by first-class mail addressed to the last known address of the person to be notified, or shall be personally served on those persons, not earlier than 30 days nor later than 15 days preceding the date to which the hearing was continued.  Service of a copy of the notice personally or by certified mail return receipt requested, or any other form of actual notice is equivalent to service by first-class mail.The notice shall contain a statement regarding the nature of the hearing to be held and any change in the custody or status of the child being recommended by the supervising agency.  The notice to the foster parent, relative caregiver, or a certified foster parent who has been approved for adoption by the State Department of Social Services when it is acting as an adoption agency or by a licensed adoption agency shall indicate that the foster parent, relative caregiver, or a certified foster parent who has been approved for adoption by the State Department of Social Services when it is acting as an adoption agency or by a licensed adoption agency may attend all hearings or may submit any information he or she deems relevant to the court in writing.(c) At least 10 calendar days prior to the hearing, the social worker shall file a supplemental report with the court regarding the services provided or offered to the parent or guardian to enable him or her to assume custody and the efforts made to achieve legal permanence for the child if efforts to reunify fail, the progress made, and, where relevant, the prognosis for return of the child to the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian, and make his or her recommendation for disposition.  If the child is a member of a sibling group described in paragraph (3) of subdivision (a) of Section 361.5, the report and recommendation may also take into account those factors described in subdivision (e) relating to the child’s sibling group. If the recommendation is not to return the child to a parent or guardian, the report shall specify why the return of the child would be detrimental to the child.  The social worker shall provide the parent or guardian with a copy of the report, including his or her recommendation for disposition, at least 10 calendar days prior to the hearing.  In the case of a child removed from the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian, the social worker shall provide a summary of his or her recommendation for disposition to the counsel for the child, any court-appointed child advocate, foster parents, relative caregivers, certified foster parents who have been approved for adoption by the State Department of Social Services when it is acting as an adoption agency or by a licensed adoption agency, community care facility, or foster family agency having the physical custody of the child at least 10 calendar days before the hearing.(d) Prior to any hearing involving a child in the physical custody of a community care facility or foster family agency that may result in the return of the child to the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian, or in adoption or the creation of a legal guardianship, the facility or agency shall file with the court a report containing its recommendation for disposition.  Prior to the hearing involving a child in the physical custody of a foster parent, a relative caregiver, or a certified foster parent who has been approved for adoption by the State Department of Social Services when it is acting as an adoption agency or by a licensed adoption agency, the foster parent, relative caregiver, or the certified foster parent who has been approved for adoption by the State Department of Social Services when it is acting as an adoption agency or by a licensed adoption agency, may file with the court a report containing his or her recommendation for disposition.  The court shall consider the report and recommendation filed pursuant to this subdivision prior to determining any disposition.(e) At the review hearing held six months after the initial dispositional hearing, the court shall order the return of the child to the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian unless the court finds, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the return of the child to his or her parent or guardian would create a substantial risk of detriment to the safety, protection, or physical or emotional well-being of the child.  The social worker shall have the burden of establishing that detriment.  The failure of the parent or guardian to participate regularly in court-ordered treatment programs shall be prima facie evidence that return would be detrimental.  In making its determination, the court shall review and consider the social worker’s report and recommendations and the report and recommendations of any child advocate appointed pursuant to Section 356.5; and shall consider the efforts or progress, or both, demonstrated by the parent or guardian and the extent to which he or she availed himself or herself of services provided.Evidence of any or all of the following circumstances shall not, in and of themselves, be deemed a failure to provide or offer reasonable services:(1) The child has been placed with a foster family that is eligible to adopt a child, or has been placed in a preadoptive home.(2) The case plan includes services to achieve legal permanence for the child if efforts to reunify fail.(3) Services to achieve legal permanence for the child, if efforts to reunify fail, are provided concurrently with services to reunify the family.Whether or not the child is returned to a parent or guardian, the court shall specify the factual basis for its conclusion that the return would be detrimental or would not be detrimental.  The court also shall make appropriate findings pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 366; and where relevant, shall order any additional services reasonably believed to facilitate the return of the child to the custody of his or her parent or guardian.  The court shall also inform the parent or guardian that if the child cannot be returned home by the 12-month permanency hearing, a proceeding pursuant to Section 366.26 may be instituted.  This section does not apply in a case where, pursuant to Section 361.5, the court has ordered that reunification services shall not be provided.If the child was under the age of three years on the date of the initial removal or is a member of a sibling group described in paragraph (3) of subdivision (a) of Section 361.5 and the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the parent failed to participate regularly in any court-ordered treatment plan, the court may schedule a hearing pursuant to Section 366.26 within 120 days.  If, however, the court finds there is a substantial probability that the child, who was under the age of three years on the date of initial removal or is a member of a sibling group described in paragraph (3) of subdivision (a) of Section 361.5, may be returned to his or her parent or guardian within six months or that reasonable services have not been provided, the court shall continue the case to the 12-month permanency hearing.For the purpose of placing and maintaining a sibling group together in a permanent home, the court, in making its determination to schedule a hearing pursuant to Section 366.26 for some or all members of a sibling group, as described in paragraph (3) of subdivision (a) of Section 361.5, shall review and consider the social worker’s report and recommendations.  Factors the report shall address, and the court shall consider, may include, but need not be limited to, whether the sibling group was removed from parental care as a group, the closeness and strength of the sibling bond, the ages of the siblings, the appropriateness of maintaining the sibling group together, the detriment to the child if sibling ties are not maintained, the likelihood of finding a permanent home for the sibling group, whether the sibling group is currently placed together in a preadoptive home or has a concurrent plan goal of legal permanency in the same home, the wishes of each child whose age and physical and emotional condition permits a meaningful response, and the best interest of each child in the sibling group.  The court shall specify the factual basis for its finding that it is in the best interest of each child to schedule a hearing pursuant to Section 366.26 in 120 days for some or all of the members of the sibling group.If the child was removed initially under subdivision (g) of Section 300 and the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the whereabouts of the parent are still unknown, or the parent has failed to contact and visit the child, the court may schedule a hearing pursuant to Section 366.26 within 120 days.  If the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the parent has been convicted of a felony indicating parental unfitness, the court may schedule a hearing pursuant to Section 366.26 within 120 days.If the child had been placed under court supervision with a previously noncustodial parent pursuant to Section 361.2, the court shall determine whether supervision is still necessary.  The court may terminate supervision and transfer permanent custody to that parent, as provided for by paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 361.2.In all other cases, the court shall direct that any reunification services previously ordered shall continue to be offered to the parent or guardian pursuant to the time periods set forth in subdivision (a) of Section 361.5, provided that the court may modify the terms and conditions of those services.If the child is not returned to his or her parent or guardian, the court shall determine whether reasonable services have been provided or offered to the parent or guardian that were designed to aid the parent or guardian in overcoming the problems that led to the initial removal and the continued custody of the child.  The court shall order that those services be initiated, continued, or terminated.(f) The permanency hearing shall be held no later than 12 months after the date the child entered foster care, as that date is determined pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 361.5.  At the permanency hearing, the court shall determine the permanent plan for the child, that shall include a determination of whether the child will be returned to the child’s home and, if so, when, within the time limits of subdivision (a) of Section 361.5.  The court shall order the return of the child to the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian unless the court finds, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the return of the child to his or her parent or guardian would create a substantial risk of detriment to the safety, protection, or physical or emotional well-being of the child.  The social worker shall have the burden of establishing that detriment.  The court shall also determine whether reasonable services have been provided or offered to the parent or guardian that were designed to aid the parent or guardian to overcome the problems that led to the initial removal and continued custody of the child.  The failure of the parent or guardian to participate regularly in court-ordered treatment programs shall be prima facie evidence that return would be detrimental.  In making its determination, the court shall review and consider the social worker’s report and recommendations and the report and recommendations of any child advocate appointed pursuant to Section 356.5; shall consider the efforts or progress, or both, demonstrated by the parent or guardian and the extent to which he or she availed himself or herself of services provided; and shall make appropriate findings pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 366.Evidence of any or all of the following circumstances shall not, in and of themselves, be deemed a failure to provide or offer reasonable services:(1) The child has been placed with a foster family that is eligible to adopt a child, or has been placed in a preadoptive home.(2) The case plan includes services to achieve legal permanence for the child if efforts to reunify fail.(3) Services to achieve legal permanence for the child, if efforts to reunify fail, are provided concurrently with services to reunify the family.Whether or not the child is returned to his or her parent or guardian, the court shall specify the factual basis for its decision.  If the child is not returned to a parent or guardian, the court shall specify the factual basis for its conclusion that the return would be detrimental. The court also shall make a finding pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 366.(g) If the time period in which the court-ordered services were provided has met or exceeded the time period set forth in paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of subdivision (a) of Section 361.5, as appropriate, and a child is not returned to the custody of a parent or guardian at the permanency hearing held pursuant to subdivision (f), the court shall do one of the following:(1) Continue the case for up to six months for a permanency review hearing, provided that the hearing shall occur within 18 months of the date the  child was originally taken from the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian.  The court shall continue the case only if it finds that there is a substantial probability that the child will be returned to the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian and safely maintained in the home within the extended period of time or that reasonable services have not been provided to the parent or guardian.  For the purposes of this section, in order to find a substantial probability that the child will be returned to the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian and safely maintained in the home within the extended period of time, the court shall be required to find all of the following:(A) That the parent or guardian has consistently and regularly contacted and visited with the child.(B) That the parent or guardian has made significant progress in resolving problems that led to the child’s removal from the home.(C) The parent or guardian has demonstrated the capacity and ability both to complete the objectives of his or her treatment plan and to provide for the child’s safety, protection, physical and emotional well-being, and special needs.The court shall inform the parent or guardian that if the child cannot be returned home by the next permanency review hearing, a proceeding pursuant to Section 366.36 may be instituted.  The court shall not order that a hearing pursuant to Section 366.26 be held unless there is clear and convincing evidence that reasonable services have been provided or offered to the parent or guardian.(2) Order that the child remain in long-term foster care, but only if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence, based upon the evidence already presented to it, including a recommendation by the State Department of Social Services when it is acting as an adoption agency or by a licensed adoption agency, that there is a compelling reason for determining that a hearing held pursuant to Section 366.26 is not in the best interest of the child because the child is not a proper subject for adoption and has no one willing to accept legal guardianship.  For purposes of this section, a recommendation by the State Department of Social Services when it is acting as an adoption agency or by a licensed adoption agency that adoption is not in the best interest of the child shall constitute a compelling reason for the court’s determination.  That recommendation shall be based on the present circumstances of the child and shall not preclude a different recommendation at a later date if the child’s circumstances change.(3) Order that a hearing be held within 120 days, pursuant to Section 366.26, if there is clear and convincing evidence that reasonable services have been provided or offered to the parents.Evidence of any or all of the following circumstances shall not, in and of themselves, be deemed a failure to provide or offer reasonable services:(A) The child has been placed with a foster family that is eligible to adopt a child, or has been placed in a preadoptive home.(B) The case plan includes services to achieve legal permanence for the child if efforts to reunify fail.(C) Services to achieve legal permanence for the child, if efforts to reunify fail, are provided concurrently with services to reunify the family.(h) In any case in which the court orders that a hearing pursuant to Section 366.26 shall be held, it shall also order the termination of reunification services to the parent.  The court shall continue to permit the parent to visit the child pending the hearing unless it finds that visitation would be detrimental to the child.(i) Whenever a court orders that a hearing pursuant to Section 366.26 shall be held, it shall direct the agency supervising the child and the licensed county adoption agency, or the State Department of Social Services when it is acting as an adoption agency in counties that are not served by a county adoption agency, to prepare an assessment that shall include:(1) Current search efforts for an absent parent or parents.(2) A review of the amount of and nature of any contact between the child and his or her parents and other members of his or her extended family since the time of placement.  Although the extended family of each child shall be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, “extended family” for the purpose of this paragraph shall include, but not be limited to, the child’s siblings, grandparents, aunts, and uncles.(3) An evaluation of the child’s medical, developmental, scholastic, mental, and emotional status.  The evaluation of the minor’s scholastic status shall include whether the child has been identified as having exceptional needs as described in Part 30 (commencing with Section 56000) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Education Code or disabilities justifying accommodations as described in Chapter 16 of Title 29 of the United States Code Annotated; and any information concerning whether the right of the parent or guardian to make educational decisions for the child has previously been limited by the court under Section 7579.5 of the Government Code; and whether the parent or guardian has previously designated an educational representative.(4) A preliminary assessment of the eligibility and commitment of any identified prospective adoptive parent or guardian, particularly the caretaker, to include a social history including screening for criminal records and prior referrals for child abuse or neglect, the capability to meet the child’s needs, and the understanding of the legal and financial rights and responsibilities of adoption and guardianship.  If a proposed guardian is a relative of the minor, and the relative was assessed for foster care placement of the minor prior to January 1, 1998, the assessment shall also consider, but need not be limited to, all of the factors specified in subdivision (a) of Section 361.3.(5) The relationship of the child to any identified prospective adoptive parent or guardian, the duration and character of the relationship, the motivation for seeking adoption or guardianship, and a statement from the child concerning placement and the adoption or guardianship, unless the child’s age or physical, emotional, or other condition precludes his or her meaningful response, and if so, a description of the condition.(6) An analysis of the likelihood that the child will be adopted if parental rights are terminated.(j) If, at any hearing held pursuant to Section 366.26, a guardianship is established for the minor with a relative, the relative shall be eligible for aid under the Kin-GAP program as provided in Article 4.5 (commencing with Section 11360) of Chapter 2 of Part 3 of Division 9.(k) As used in this section, “relative” means an adult who is related to the minor by blood, adoption, or affinity within the fifth degree of kinship, including stepparents, stepsiblings, and all relatives whose status is preceded by the words “great,” “great-great,” or “grand,” or the spouse of any of those persons even if the marriage was terminated by death or dissolution.SEC. 12.2. Section 366.21 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:366.21. (a) Every hearing conducted by the juvenile court reviewing the status of a dependent child shall be placed on the appearance calendar. The court shall advise all persons present at the hearing of the date of the future hearing and of their right to be present and represented by counsel.(b) Except as provided in Section 366.23 and subdivision (a) of Section 366.3, notice of the hearing shall be mailed by the social worker to the same persons as in the original proceeding, to the child’s parent or guardian, to the foster parents, relative caregivers, community care facility, or foster family agency having physical custody of the child in the case of a child removed from the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian, and to the counsel of record if the counsel of record was not present at the time that the hearing was set by the court, by first-class mail addressed to the last known address of the person to be notified, or shall be personally served on those persons, not earlier than 30 days nor later than 15 days preceding the date to which the hearing was continued.  Service of a copy of the notice personally or by certified mail return receipt requested, or any other form of actual notice is equivalent to service by first-class mail.The notice shall contain a statement regarding the nature of the hearing to be held and any change in the custody or status of the child being recommended by the supervising agency.  The notice to the foster parent, relative caregiver, or a certified foster parent who has been approved for adoption by the State Department of Social Services when it is acting as an adoption agency or by a licensed adoption agency shall indicate that the foster parent, relative caregiver, or a certified foster parent who has been approved for adoption by the State Department of Social Services when it is acting as an adoption agency or by a licensed adoption agency may attend all hearings or may submit any information he or she deems relevant to the court in writing.(c) At least 10 calendar days prior to the hearing the social worker shall file a supplemental report with the court regarding the services provided or offered to the parent or guardian to enable him or her to assume custody and the efforts made to achieve legal permanence for the child if efforts to reunify fail, the progress made, and, where relevant, the prognosis for return of the child to the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian, and make his or her recommendation for disposition.  If the recommendation is not to return the child to a parent or guardian, the report shall specify why the return of the child would be detrimental to the child. The social worker shall provide the parent or guardian with a copy of the report, including his or her recommendation for disposition, at least 10 calendar days prior to the hearing.  In the case of a child removed from the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian, the social worker shall provide a summary of his or her recommendation for disposition to the counsel for the child, any court-appointed child advocate, foster parents, relative caregivers, certified foster parents who have been approved for adoption by the State Department of Social Services when it is acting as an adoption agency or by a licensed adoption agency, community care facility, or foster family agency having the physical custody of the child at least 10 calendar days before the hearing.(d) Prior to any hearing involving a child in the physical custody of a community care facility or foster family agency that may result in the return of the child to the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian, or in adoption or the creation of a legal guardianship, the facility or agency shall file with the court a report containing its recommendation for disposition.  Prior to the hearing involving a child in the physical custody of a foster parent, a relative caregiver, or a certified foster parent who has been approved for adoption by the State Department of Social Services when it is acting as an adoption agency or by a licensed adoption agency, the foster parent, relative caregiver, or the certified foster parent who has been approved for adoption by the State Department of Social Services when it is acting as an adoption agency or by a licensed adoption agency, may file with the court a report containing his or her recommendation for disposition.  The court shall consider the report and recommendation filed pursuant to this subdivision prior to determining any disposition.(e) At the review hearing held six months after the initial dispositional hearing, the court shall order the return of the child to the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian unless the court finds, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the return of the child to his or her parent or guardian would create a substantial risk of detriment to the safety, protection, or physical or emotional well-being of the child.  The social worker shall have the burden of establishing that detriment.  The failure of the parent or guardian to participate regularly and make substantive progress in court-ordered treatment programs shall be prima facie evidence that return would be detrimental.  In making its determination, the court shall review and consider the social worker’s report and recommendations and the report and recommendations of any child advocate appointed pursuant to Section 356.5; and shall consider the efforts or progress, or both, demonstrated by the parent or guardian and the extent to which he or she availed himself or herself of services provided.Evidence of any or all of the following circumstances shall not, in and of themselves, be deemed a failure to provide or offer reasonable services:(1) The child has been placed with a foster family that is eligible to adopt a child, or has been placed in a preadoptive home.(2) The case plan includes services to achieve legal permanence for the child if efforts to reunify fail.(3) Services to achieve legal permanence for the child, if efforts to reunify fail, are provided concurrently with services to reunify the family.Whether or not the child is returned to a parent or guardian, the court shall specify the factual basis for its conclusion that the return would be detrimental or would not be detrimental.  The court also shall make appropriate findings pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 366; and where relevant, shall order any additional services reasonably believed to facilitate the return of the child to the custody of his or her parent or guardian.  The court shall also inform the parent or guardian that if the child cannot be returned home by the 12-month permanency hearing, a proceeding pursuant to Section 366.26 may be instituted.  This section does not apply in a case where, pursuant to Section 361.5, the court has ordered that reunification services shall not be provided.If the child was under the age of three years on the date of the initial removal and the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the parent failed to participate regularly and make substantive progress in a court-ordered treatment plan, the court may schedule a hearing pursuant to Section 366.26 within 120 days.  If, however, the court finds there is a substantial probability that the child, who was under the age of three years on the date of initial removal, may be returned to his or her parent or guardian within six months or that reasonable services have not been provided, the court shall continue the case to the 12-month permanency hearing.If the child was removed initially under subdivision (g) of Section 300 and the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the whereabouts of the parent are still unknown, or the parent has failed to contact and visit the child, the court may schedule a hearing pursuant to Section 366.26 within 120 days.  If the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the parent has been convicted of a felony indicating parental unfitness, the court may schedule a hearing pursuant to Section 366.26 within 120 days.If the child had been placed under court supervision with a previously noncustodial parent pursuant to Section 361.2, the court shall determine whether supervision is still necessary.  The court may terminate supervision and transfer permanent custody to that parent, as provided for by paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 361.2.In all other cases, the court shall direct that any reunification services previously ordered shall continue to be offered to the parent or guardian pursuant to the time periods set forth in subdivision (a) of Section 361.5, provided that the court may modify the terms and conditions of those services.If the child is not returned to his or her parent or guardian, the court shall determine whether reasonable services have been provided or offered to the parent or guardian which were designed to aid the parent or guardian in overcoming the problems which led to the initial removal and the continued custody of the child.  The court shall order that those services be initiated, continued, or terminated.(f) The permanency hearing shall be held no later than 12 months after the date the child entered foster care, as that date is determined pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 361.5.  At the permanency hearing, the court shall determine the permanent plan for the child, that shall include a determination of whether the child will be returned to the child’s home and, if so, when, within the time limits of subdivision (a) of Section 361.5.  The court shall order the return of the child to the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian unless the court finds, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the return of the child to his or her parent or guardian would create a substantial risk of detriment to the safety, protection, or physical or emotional well-being of the child.  The social worker shall have the burden of establishing that detriment.  The court shall also determine whether reasonable services have been provided or offered to the parent or guardian that were designed to aid the parent or guardian to overcome the problems that led to the initial removal and continued custody of the child.  The failure of the parent or guardian to participate regularly and make substantive progress in court-ordered treatment programs shall be prima facie evidence that return would be detrimental.  In making its determination, the court shall review and consider the social worker’s report and recommendations and the report and recommendations of any child advocate appointed pursuant to Section 356.5; shall consider the efforts or progress, or both, demonstrated by the parent or guardian and the extent to which he or she availed himself or herself of services provided; and shall make appropriate findings pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 366.Evidence of any or all of the following circumstances shall not, in and of themselves, be deemed a failure to provide or offer reasonable services:(1) The child has been placed with a foster family that is eligible to adopt a child, or has been placed in a preadoptive home.(2) The case plan includes services to achieve legal permanence for the child if efforts to reunify fail.(3) Services to achieve legal permanence for the child, if efforts to reunify fail, are provided concurrently with services to reunify the family.Whether or not the child is returned to his or her parent or guardian, the court shall specify the factual basis for its decision.  If the child is not returned to a parent or guardian, the court shall specify the factual basis for its conclusion that the return would be detrimental.  The court also shall make a finding pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 366.(g) If the time period in which the court-ordered services were provided has met or exceeded the time period set forth in paragraph (1) or (2) of subdivision (a) of Section 361.5, as appropriate, and a child is not returned to the custody of a parent or guardian at the permanency hearing held pursuant to subdivision (f), the court shall do one of the following:(1) Continue the case for up to six months for a permanency review hearing, provided that the hearing shall occur within 18 months of the date the  child was originally taken from the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian.  The court shall continue the case only if it finds that there is a substantial probability that the child will be returned to the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian and safely maintained in the home within the extended period of time or that reasonable services have not been provided to the parent or guardian.  For the purposes of this section, in order to find a substantial probability that the child will be returned to the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian and safely maintained in the home within the extended period of time, the court shall be required to find all of the following:(A) That the parent or guardian has consistently and regularly contacted and visited with the child.(B) That the parent or guardian has made significant progress in resolving problems that led to the child’s removal from the home.(C) The parent or guardian has demonstrated the capacity and ability both to complete the objectives of his or her treatment plan and to provide for the child’s safety, protection, physical and emotional well-being, and special needs.The court shall inform the parent or guardian that if the child cannot be returned home by the next permanency review hearing, a proceeding pursuant to Section 366.36 may be instituted.  The court shall not order that a hearing pursuant to Section 366.26 be held unless there is clear and convincing evidence that reasonable services have been provided or offered to the parent or guardian.(2) Order that the child remain in long-term foster care, but only if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence, based upon the evidence already presented to it, including a recommendation by the State Department of Social Services when it is acting as an adoption agency or by a licensed adoption agency, that there is a compelling reason for determining that a hearing held pursuant to Section 366.26 is not in the best interest of the child because the child is not a proper subject for adoption and has no one willing to accept legal guardianship.  For purposes of this section, a recommendation by the State Department of Social Services when it is acting as an adoption agency or by a licensed adoption agency that adoption is not in the best interest of the child shall constitute a compelling reason for the court’s determination.  That recommendation shall be based on the present circumstances of the child and shall not preclude a different recommendation at a later date if the child’s circumstances change.(3) Order that a hearing be held within 120 days, pursuant to Section 366.26, if there is clear and convincing evidence that reasonable services have been provided or offered to the parents.Evidence of any or all of the following circumstances shall not, in and of themselves, be deemed a failure to provide or offer reasonable services:(A) The child has been placed with a foster family that is eligible to adopt a child, or has been placed in a preadoptive home.(B) The case plan includes services to achieve legal permanence for the child if efforts to reunify fail.(C) Services to achieve legal permanence for the child, if efforts to reunify fail, are provided concurrently with services to reunify the family.(h) In any case in which the court orders that a hearing pursuant to Section 366.26 shall be held, it shall also order the termination of reunification services to the parent.  The court shall continue to permit the parent to visit the child pending the hearing unless it finds that visitation would be detrimental to the child.(i) Whenever a court orders that a hearing pursuant to Section 366.26 shall be held, it shall direct the agency supervising the child and the licensed county adoption agency, or the State Department of Social Services when it is acting as an adoption agency in counties that are not served by a county adoption agency, to prepare an assessment that shall include:(1) Current search efforts for an absent parent or parents.(2) A review of the amount of and nature of any contact between the child and his or her parents and other members of his or her extended family since the time of placement.  Although the extended family of each child shall be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, “extended family” for the purpose of this paragraph shall include, but not be limited to, the child’s siblings, grandparents, aunts, and uncles.(3) An evaluation of the child’s medical, developmental, scholastic, mental, and emotional status.  The evaluation of the minor’s scholastic status shall include whether the child has been identified as having exceptional needs as described in Part 30 (commencing with Section 56000) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Education Code or disabilities justifying accommodations as described in Chapter 16 of Title 29 of the United States Code Annotated; and any information concerning whether the right of the parent or guardian to make educational decisions for the child has previously been limited by the court under Section 7579.5 of the Government Code; and whether the parent or guardian has previously designated an educational representative.(4) A preliminary assessment of the eligibility and commitment of any identified prospective adoptive parent or guardian, particularly the caretaker, to include a social history including screening for criminal records and prior referrals for child abuse or neglect, the capability to meet the child’s needs, and the understanding of the legal and financial rights and responsibilities of adoption and guardianship.  If a proposed guardian is a relative of the minor, and the relative was assessed for foster care placement of the minor prior to January 1, 1998, the assessment shall also consider, but need not be limited to, all of the factors specified in subdivision (a) of Section 361.3.(5) The relationship of the child to any identified prospective adoptive parent or guardian, the duration and character of the relationship, the motivation for seeking adoption or guardianship, and a statement from the child concerning placement and the adoption or guardianship, unless the child’s age or physical, emotional, or other condition precludes his or her meaningful response, and if so, a description of the condition.(6) An analysis of the likelihood that the child will be adopted if parental rights are terminated.(j) If, at any hearing held pursuant to Section 366.26, a guardianship is established for the minor with a relative, the relative shall be eligible for aid under the Kin-GAP program as provided in Article 4.5 (commencing with Section 11360) of Chapter 2 of Part 3 of Division 9.(k) As used in this section, “relative” means an adult who is related to the minor by blood, adoption, or affinity within the fifth degree of kinship, including stepparents, stepsiblings, and all relatives whose status is preceded by the words “great,” “great-great,” or “grand,” or the spouse of any of those persons even if the marriage was terminated by death or dissolution.SEC. 12.3. Section 366.21 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:366.21. (a) Every hearing conducted by the juvenile court reviewing the status of a dependent child shall be placed on the appearance calendar. The court shall advise all persons present at the hearing of the date of the future hearing and of their right to be present and represented by counsel.(b) Except as provided in Section 366.23 and subdivision (a) of Section 366.3, notice of the hearing shall be mailed by the social worker to the same persons as in the original proceeding, to the child’s parent or guardian, to the foster parents, relative caregivers, community care facility, or foster family agency having physical custody of the child in the case of a child removed from the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian, and to the counsel of record if the counsel of record was not present at the time that the hearing was set by the court, by first-class mail addressed to the last known address of the person to be notified, or shall be personally served on those persons, not earlier than 30 days nor later than 15 days preceding the date to which the hearing was continued.  Service of a copy of the notice personally or by certified mail return receipt requested, or any other form of actual notice is equivalent to service by first-class mail.The notice shall contain a statement regarding the nature of the hearing to be held and any change in the custody or status of the child being recommended by the supervising agency.  The notice to the foster parent, relative caregiver, or a certified foster parent who has been approved for adoption by the State Department of Social Services when it is acting as an adoption agency or by a licensed adoption agency shall indicate that the foster parent, relative caregiver, or a certified foster parent who has been approved for adoption by the State Department of Social Services when it is acting as an adoption agency or by a licensed adoption agency may attend all hearings or may submit any information he or she deems relevant to the court in writing.(c) At least 10 calendar days prior to the hearing, the social worker shall file a supplemental report with the court regarding the services provided or offered to the parent or guardian to enable him or her to assume custody and the efforts made to achieve legal permanence for the child if efforts to reunify fail, the progress made, and, where relevant, the prognosis for return of the child to the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian, and make his or her recommendation for disposition.  If the child is a member of a sibling group described in paragraph (3) of subdivision (a) of Section 361.5, the report and recommendation may also take into account those factors described in subdivision (e) relating to the child’s sibling group. If the recommendation is not to return the child to a parent or guardian, the report shall specify why the return of the child would be detrimental to the child.  The social worker shall provide the parent or guardian with a copy of the report, including his or her recommendation for disposition, at least 10 calendar days prior to the hearing.  In the case of a child removed from the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian, the social worker shall provide a summary of his or her recommendation for disposition to the counsel for the child, any court-appointed child advocate, foster parents, relative caregivers, certified foster parents who have been approved for adoption by the State Department of Social Services when it is acting as an adoption agency or by a licensed adoption agency, community care facility, or foster family agency having the physical custody of the child at least 10 calendar days before the hearing.(d) Prior to any hearing involving a child in the physical custody of a community care facility or foster family agency that may result in the return of the child to the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian, or in adoption or the creation of a legal guardianship, the facility or agency shall file with the court a report containing its recommendation for disposition.  Prior to the hearing involving a child in the physical custody of a foster parent, a relative caregiver, or a certified foster parent who has been approved for adoption by the State Department of Social Services when it is acting as an adoption agency or by a licensed adoption agency, the foster parent, relative caregiver, or the certified foster parent who has been approved for adoption by the State Department of Social Services when it is acting as an adoption agency or by a licensed adoption agency, may file with the court a report containing his or her recommendation for disposition.  The court shall consider the report and recommendation filed pursuant to this subdivision prior to determining any disposition.(e) At the review hearing held six months after the initial dispositional hearing, the court shall order the return of the child to the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian unless the court finds, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the return of the child to his or her parent or guardian would create a substantial risk of detriment to the safety, protection, or physical or emotional well-being of the child.

The court also shall make appropriate findings pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 366; and where relevant, shall order any additional services reasonably believed to facilitate the return of the child to the custody of his or her parent or guardian.  The court shall also inform the parent or guardian that if the child cannot be returned home by the 12-month permanency hearing, a proceeding pursuant to Section 366.26 may be instituted.  This section does not apply in a case where, pursuant to Section 361.5, the court has ordered that reunification services shall not be provided.If the child was under the age of three years on the date of the initial removal or is a member of a sibling group described in paragraph (3) of subdivision (a) of Section 361.5 and the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the parent failed to participate regularly and make substantive progress in a court-ordered treatment plan, the court may schedule a hearing pursuant to Section 366.26 within 120 days.  If, however, the court finds there is a substantial probability that the child, who was under the age of three years on the date of initial removal or is a member of a sibling group described in paragraph (3) of subdivision (a) of Section 361.5, may be returned to his or her parent or guardian within six months or that reasonable services have not been provided, the court shall continue the case to the 12-month permanency hearing.For the purpose of placing and maintaining a sibling group together in a permanent home, the court, in making its determination to schedule a hearing pursuant to Section 366.26 for some or all members of a sibling group, as described in paragraph (3) of subdivision (a) of Section 361.5, shall review and consider the social worker’s report and recommendations.  Factors the report shall address, and the court shall consider, may include, but need not be limited to, whether the sibling group was removed from parental care as a group, the closeness and strength of the sibling bond, the ages of the siblings, the appropriateness of maintaining the sibling group together, the detriment to the child if sibling ties are not maintained, the likelihood of finding a permanent home for the sibling group, whether the sibling group is currently placed together in a preadoptive home or has a concurrent plan goal of legal permanency in the same home, the wishes of each child whose age and physical and emotional condition permits a meaningful response, and the best interest of each child in the sibling group.  The court shall specify the factual basis for its finding that it is in the best interest of each child to schedule a hearing pursuant to Section 366.26 in 120 days for some or all of the members of the sibling group.If the child was removed initially under subdivision (g) of Section 300 and the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the whereabouts of the parent are still unknown, or the parent has failed to contact and visit the child, the court may schedule a hearing pursuant to Section 366.26 within 120 days.  If the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the parent has been convicted of a felony indicating parental unfitness, the court may schedule a hearing pursuant to Section 366.26 within 120 days.If the child had been placed under court supervision with a previously noncustodial parent pursuant to Section 361.2, the court shall determine whether supervision is still necessary.  The court may terminate supervision and transfer permanent custody to that parent, as provided for by paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 361.2.In all other cases, the court shall direct that any reunification services previously ordered shall continue to be offered to the parent or guardian pursuant to the time periods set forth in subdivision (a) of Section 361.5, provided that the court may modify the terms and conditions of those services.If the child is not returned to his or her parent or guardian, the court shall determine whether reasonable services have been provided or offered to the parent or guardian that were designed to aid the parent or guardian in overcoming the problems that led to the initial removal and the continued custody of the child.  The court shall order that those services be initiated, continued, or terminated.(f) The permanency hearing shall be held no later than 12 months after the date the child entered foster care, as that date is determined pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 361.5.  At the permanency hearing, the court shall determine the permanent plan for the child, that shall include a determination of whether the child will be returned to the child’s home and, if so, when, within the time limits of subdivision (a) of Section 361.5.  The court shall order the return of the child to the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian unless the court finds, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the return of the child to his or her parent or guardian would create a substantial risk of detriment to the safety, protection, or physical or emotional well-being of the child.  The social worker shall have the burden of establishing that detriment.  The court shall also determine whether reasonable services have been provided or offered to the parent or guardian that were designed to aid the parent or guardian to overcome the problems that led to the initial removal and continued custody of the child.  The failure of the parent or guardian to participate regularly and make substantive progress in court-ordered treatment programs shall be prima facie evidence that return would be detrimental.  In making its determination, the court shall review and consider the social worker’s report and recommendations and the report and recommendations of any child advocate appointed pursuant to Section 356.5; shall consider the efforts or progress, or both, demonstrated by the parent or guardian and the extent to which he or she availed himself or herself of services provided; and shall make appropriate findings pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 366.Evidence of any or all of the following circumstances shall not, in and of themselves, be deemed a failure to provide or offer reasonable services:(1) The child has been placed with a foster family that is eligible to adopt a child, or has been placed in a preadoptive home.(2) The case plan includes services to achieve legal permanence for the child if efforts to reunify fail.(3) Services to achieve legal permanence for the child, if efforts to reunify fail, are provided concurrently with services to reunify the family.Whether or not the child is returned to his or her parent or guardian, the court shall specify the factual basis for its decision.  If the child is not returned to a parent or guardian, the court shall specify the factual basis for its conclusion that the return would be detrimental. The court also shall make a finding pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 366.(g) If the time period in which the court-ordered services were provided has met or exceeded the time period set forth in paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of subdivision (a) of Section 361.5, as appropriate, and a child is not returned to the custody of a parent or guardian at the permanency hearing held pursuant to subdivision (f), the court shall do one of the following:(1) Continue the case for up to six months for a permanency review hearing, provided that the hearing shall occur within 18 months of the date the  child was originally taken from the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian.  The court shall continue the case only if it finds that there is a substantial probability that the child will be returned to the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian and safely maintained in the home within the extended period of time or that reasonable services have not been provided to the parent or guardian.  For the purposes of this section, in order to find a substantial probability that the child will be returned to the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian and safely maintained in the home within the extended period of time, the court shall be required to find all of the following:(A) That the parent or guardian has consistently and regularly contacted and visited with the child.(B) That the parent or guardian has made significant progress in resolving problems that led to the child’s removal from the home.(C) The parent or guardian has demonstrated the capacity and ability both to complete the objectives of his or her treatment plan and to provide for the child’s safety, protection, physical and emotional well-being, and special needs.The court shall inform the parent or guardian that if the child cannot be returned home by the next permanency review hearing, a proceeding pursuant to Section 366.36 may be instituted.  The court shall not order that a hearing pursuant to Section 366.26 be held unless there is clear and convincing evidence that reasonable services have been provided or offered to the parent or guardian.(2) Order that the child remain in long-term foster care, but only if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence, based upon the evidence already presented to it, including a recommendation by the State Department of Social Services when it is acting as an adoption agency or by a licensed adoption agency, that there is a compelling reason for determining that a hearing held pursuant to Section 366.26 is not in the best interest of the child because the child is not a proper subject for adoption and has no one willing to accept legal guardianship.  For purposes of this section, a recommendation by the State Department of Social Services when it is acting as an adoption agency or by a licensed adoption agency that adoption is not in the best interest of the child shall constitute a compelling reason for the court’s determination.  That recommendation shall be based on the present circumstances of the child and shall not preclude a different recommendation at a later date if the child’s circumstances change.(3) Order that a hearing be held within 120 days, pursuant to Section 366.26, if there is clear and convincing evidence that reasonable services have been provided or offered to the parents.Evidence of any or all of the following circumstances shall not, in and of themselves, be deemed a failure to provide or offer reasonable services:(A) The child has been placed with a foster family that is eligible to adopt a child, or has been placed in a preadoptive home.(B) The case plan includes services to achieve legal permanence for the child if efforts to reunify fail.(C) Services to achieve legal permanence for the child, if efforts to reunify fail, are provided concurrently with services to reunify the family.(h) In any case in which the court orders that a hearing pursuant to Section 366.26 shall be held, it shall also order the termination of reunification services to the parent.  The court shall continue to permit the parent to visit the child pending the hearing unless it finds that visitation would be detrimental to the child.(i) Whenever a court orders that a hearing pursuant to Section 366.26 shall be held, it shall direct the agency supervising the child and the licensed county adoption agency, or the State Department of Social Services when it is acting as an adoption agency in counties that are not served by a county adoption agency, to prepare an assessment that shall include:(1) Current search efforts for an absent parent or parents.(2) A review of the amount of and nature of any contact between the child and his or her parents and other members of his or her extended family since the time of placement.  Although the extended family of each child shall be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, “extended family” for the purpose of this paragraph shall include, but not be limited to, the child’s siblings, grandparents, aunts, and uncles.(3) An evaluation of the child’s medical, developmental, scholastic, mental, and emotional status.  The evaluation of the minor’s scholastic status shall include whether the child has been identified as having exceptional needs as described in Part 30 (commencing with Section 56000) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Education Code or disabilities justifying accommodations as described in Chapter 16 of Title 29 of the United States Code Annotated; and any information concerning whether the right of the parent or guardian to make educational decisions for the child has previously been limited by the court under Section 7579.5 of the Government Code; and whether the parent or guardian has previously designated an educational representative.(4) A preliminary assessment of the eligibility and commitment of any identified prospective adoptive parent or guardian, particularly the caretaker, to include a social history including screening for criminal records and prior referrals for child abuse or neglect, the capability to meet the child’s needs, and the understanding of the legal and financial rights and responsibilities of adoption and guardianship.  If a proposed guardian is a relative of the minor, and the relative was assessed for foster care placement of the minor prior to January 1, 1998, the assessment shall also consider, but need not be limited to, all of the factors specified in subdivision (a) of Section 361.3.(5) The relationship of the child to any identified prospective adoptive parent or guardian, the duration and character of the relationship, the motivation for seeking adoption or guardianship, and a statement from the child concerning placement and the adoption or guardianship, unless the child’s age or physical, emotional, or other condition precludes his or her meaningful response, and if so, a description of the condition.(6) An analysis of the likelihood that the child will be adopted if parental rights are terminated.(j) If, at any hearing held pursuant to Section 366.26, a guardianship is established for the minor with a relative, the relative shall be eligible for aid under the Kin-GAP program as provided in Article 4.5 (commencing with Section 11360) of Chapter 2 of Part 3 of Division 9.(k) As used in this section, “relative” means an adult who is related to the minor by blood, adoption, or affinity within the fifth degree of kinship, including stepparents, stepsiblings, and all relatives whose status is preceded by the words “great,” “great-great,” or “grand,” or the spouse of any of those persons even if the marriage was terminated by death or dissolution.SEC. 13. Section 366.22 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:366.22. (a) When a case has been continued pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (g) of Section 366.21, the permanency review hearing shall occur within 18 months after the date the child was originally removed from the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian.  The court shall order the return of the child to the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian unless the court finds, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the return of the child to his or her parent or guardian would create a substantial risk of detriment to the safety, protection, or physical or emotional well-being of the child.  The social worker shall have the burden of establishing that detriment.  The failure of the parent or guardian to participate regularly in court-ordered treatment programs shall be prima facie evidence that return would be detrimental.  In making its determination, the court shall review and consider the social worker’s report and recommendations and the report and recommendations of any child advocate appointed pursuant to Section 356.5; shall consider the efforts or progress, or both, demonstrated by the parent or guardian and the extent to which he or she availed himself or herself of services provided; and shall make appropriate findings pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 366.Evidence of any or all of the following circumstances shall not, in and of themselves, be deemed a failure to provide or offer reasonable services:(1) The child has been placed with a foster family that is eligible to adopt a child, or has been placed in a preadoptive home.(2) The case plan includes services to achieve legal permanence for the child if efforts to reunify fail.(3) Services to achieve legal permanence for the child, if efforts to reunify fail, are provided concurrently with services to reunify the family.Whether or not the child is returned to his or her parent or guardian, the court shall specify the factual basis for its decision.  If the child is not returned to a parent or guardian, the court shall specify the factual basis for its conclusion that return would be detrimental.If the child is not returned to a parent or guardian at the permanency review hearing, the court shall order that a hearing be held pursuant to Section 366.26 in order to determine whether adoption, guardianship, or long-term foster care is the most appropriate plan for the child.  However, if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence, based on the evidence already presented to it, including a recommendation by the State Department of Social Services when it is acting as an adoption agency or by a licensed adoption agency, that there is a compelling reason, as described in paragraph (2) of subdivision (g) of Section 366.21, for determining that a hearing held under Section 366.26 is not in the best interest of the child because the child is not a proper subject for adoption and has no one willing to accept legal guardianship, then the court may, only under these circumstances, order that the child remain in long-term foster care.  The hearing shall be held no later than 120 days from the date of the permanency review hearing.  The court shall also order termination of reunification services to the parent.  The court shall continue to permit the parent to visit the child unless it finds that visitation would be detrimental to the child.  The court shall determine whether reasonable services have been offered or provided to the parent or guardian.(b) Whenever a court orders that a hearing pursuant to Section 366.26 shall be held, it shall direct the agency supervising the child and the licensed county adoption agency, or the State Department of Social Services when it is acting as an adoption agency in counties that are not served by a county adoption agency, to prepare an assessment that shall include:(1) Current search efforts for an absent parent or parents.(2) A review of the amount of and nature of any contact between the child and his or her parents and other members of his or her extended family since the time of placement.  Although the extended family of each child shall be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, “extended family” for the purposes of this paragraph shall include, but not be limited to, the child’s siblings, grandparents, aunts, and uncles.(3) An evaluation of the child’s medical, developmental, scholastic, mental, and emotional status.  The evaluation of the minor’s scholastic status shall include whether the child has been identified as having exceptional needs as described in Part 30 (commencing with Section 56000) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Education Code or disabilities justifying accommodations as described in Chapter 16 of Title 29 of the United States Code Annotated; and any information concerning whether the right of the parent or guardian to make educational decisions for the child has previously been limited by the court under Section 7579.5 of the Government Code; and whether the parent or guardian has previously designated and educational representative.(4) A preliminary assessment of the eligibility and commitment of any identified prospective adoptive parent or guardian, particularly the caretaker, to include a social history including screening for criminal records and prior referrals for child abuse or neglect, the capability to meet the child’s needs, and the understanding of the legal and financial rights and responsibilities of adoption and guardianship.  If a proposed guardian is a relative of the minor, and the relative was assessed for foster care placement of the minor prior to January 1, 1998, the assessment shall also consider, but need not be limited to, all of the factors specified in subdivision (a) of Section 361.3.(5) The relationship of the child to any identified prospective adoptive parent or guardian, the duration and character of the relationship, the motivation for seeking adoption or guardianship, and a statement from the child concerning placement and the adoption or guardianship, unless the child’s age or physical, emotional, or other condition precludes his or her meaningful response, and if so, a description of the condition.(6) An analysis of the likelihood that the child will be adopted if parental rights are terminated.(c) This section shall become operative January 1, 1999.  If at any hearing held pursuant to Section 366.26, a guardianship is established for the minor with a relative, the relative shall be eligible for aid under the Kin-GAP program as provided in Article 4.5 (commencing with Section 11360) of Chapter 2 of Part 3 of Division 9.(d) As used in this section, “relative” means an adult who is related to the minor by blood, adoption, or affinity within the fifth degree of kinship, including stepparents, stepsiblings, and all relatives whose status is preceded by the words “great,” “great-great,” or “grand,” or the spouse of any of those persons even if the marriage was terminated by death or dissolution.SEC. 14. Section 706.5 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:706.5. Each social study made by a probation officer that is received into evidence pursuant to Section 706 shall include, but is not limited to, the factual material described in subdivisions (g) and (h) of Section 358.1. When placement within foster care is considered, the social study made by a probation officer that is received into evidence pursuant to Section 706 shall also include the factual material described in subdivisions (a) and (b) of Section 358.1.  The probation officer shall solicit comment from the appropriate local education agency prior to completion of the study.SEC. 14.5. Section 706.5 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:706.5. Each social study made by a probation officer  that is received  into evidence pursuant to Section 706 shall include, but is not limited to, the factual material listed in  subdivision (b) of Section 727.4.  When placement made within foster care is considered, the social study made by a probation officer that is received into evidence pursuant to Section 706 shall also include the factual material described in subdivisions (a) and (b) of Section 727.4.  The probation officer shall solicit comment from the appropriate local education agency prior to completion of the study.SEC. 15. Section 1401 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:1401. The Legislature finds and declares that:(a) There is a continuing need to institute early intervention and prevention programs for children and their families at risk of coming under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court as a consequence of either delinquent conduct of the child or parental abuse and neglect, including neglect by the parent of the education needs of the child, including the need for special education and related services if the child has exceptional needs as described in Part 30 (commencing with Section 56000) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Education Code or rights to accommodations if the child has disabilities as described in Chapter 16 of Title 29 of the United States Code Annotated.(b) Children and their families at risk of coming under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court shall, in conformity with the interests of public safety and protection, receive community-based care, treatment, and guidance which is consistent with their best interests and which holds them accountable for their behavior.(c) Currently, children come under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court because of one or more of the following:(1) They have committed a criminal offense and are classified as wards of the court owing to their delinquent conduct.(2) They are habitually disobedient or truant and are designated wards of the court because they are beyond parental control.(3) They are in need of protective services and are classified as dependents of the court because they have been abused or neglected by a parent or guardian.(d) Each juvenile court in California has the responsibility to address every case coming before it on an individual basis, recognizing the educational needs of each child, the child’s family, and the community in which the conduct has occurred.  Severely neglected and abused children, and children whose pattern of criminal conduct is well established or whose criminal acts are serious, make up the bulk of the cases handled by the juvenile courts.  The procedural requirements are strict, the time limits are short, and the cases are usually complex, with substantial impact on the child and family, the probation and social services systems in the county, and the public at large.(e) Attorneys represent children and family members in juvenile court, and because the stakes are high, many cases are contested.  Hearings on these matters are usually emotional, often lengthy, and always expensive.  Once the juvenile court assumes jurisdiction of the case, the assistance needed by the children and their families is comprehensive and costly, and resources are often inadequate.(f) Considerably greater public resources have been spent on treating adverse outcomes than on preventing them.(g) The current juvenile justice system is not meeting the needs of at-risk children and their families owing to a lack of community-based intervention and prevention programs, or appropriate education services, including the right to receive special education and related services if the child has exceptional needs as described in Part 30 (commencing with Section 56000) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Education Code and the right to receive accommodations if the child has disabilities as described in Chapter 16 of Title 29 of the United States Code Annotated.(h) Because of limited resources, only the most serious cases come before the juvenile court, and by the time the court is asked to address the problems, it is often too late.  The system of authoritative intervention by the courts and public agencies focuses on and labels children and families who could have remained out of that system if served earlier and more comprehensively.(i) California juvenile courts are overwhelmed as a result of dramatically increased caseloads and the scarcity or inadequacy of resources to address the problems precipitating court involvement.(j) Children and families who could benefit from early intervention and prevention programs are frequently overlooked until the conduct or condition becomes so aggravated that court action is required.SEC. 16. Section 1402 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:1402. It is the intent of the Legislature to:(a) Establish a model for Family Assessment Intervention and Resource (FAIR) centers for prevention and early intervention, with the juvenile court playing an important role in this judicially supervised, nonadversarial program that will result in a reduction and reallocation of costs to the court system.  The purpose of the FAIR center is to do all of the following:(1) Offer community-based prevention, intervention, and treatment services in a neighborhood setting.(2) Serve as a resource for children whose conduct or condition comes within statutory descriptions, but whose cases are amenable to resolution short of court intervention or are not yet serious enough to warrant the immediate filing of a juvenile court petition.(3) Reduce the need for intensive judicial intervention in the future with concomitant savings in appointed attorney fees and court support costs.(4) Shift the focus of intervention toward individual and family responsibility and accountability while eliminating the practice of labeling children according only to statutory definitions.(5) Enhance the effectiveness of the judicial system and the role of the juvenile court.(6) Coordinate with appropriate local education agencies to assist in meeting the education needs of children, including special education and related services if the child has exceptional needs as described in Part 30 (commencing with Section 56000) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Education Code or for accommodations if the child has disabilities as described in Chapter 16 of Title 29 of the United States Code Annotated.(b) Establish pilot and demonstration projects in up to three counties to fulfill the FAIR center model goal and to evaluate whether the FAIR center model better meets the needs of at-risk children and their families in a cost-effective manner by providing a community-based intervention and prevention program.  The pilot and demonstration projects shall include all of the following:(1) A process by which, in lieu of filing a petition to declare a child a ward or a dependent, at-risk children and their families are referred to a FAIR center.  The process shall include the filing of a petition under Section 1420, as provided in Section 1410.(2) A community-based FAIR center that will provide referrals or services adapted to the individual families and the communities or neighborhoods to be served.(3) A contractual agreement between families referred to FAIR centers and FAIR center representatives encouraging compliance with a case plan for recommended services.  The contractual agreement shall be filed with the local juvenile court.(4) Establish procedures to ensure individual accountability on the part of each family member to fulfill contractual agreements made with the FAIR center.SEC. 16.5. Section 10.5 of this bill incorporates amendments to Section 361 of the Welfare and Institutions Code proposed by both this bill and AB 1020.  It shall only become operative if (1) both bills are enacted and become effective on or before January 1, 2000, (2) each bill amends Section 361 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, and (3) this bill is enacted after AB 1020, in which case Section 10 of this bill shall not become operative.SEC. 17. (a) Section 3.5 of this bill incorporates amendments to Section 202 of the Welfare and Institutions Code proposed by both this bill and AB 575.
