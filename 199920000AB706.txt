                LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 706, Torlakson.
                          Community warning systems:  donor organizations:  immunity.Existing law provides that a nonprofit public benefit corporation that has donated in whole or in part a community warning system to a county of the ninth class, known as a donor organization, is immune from suit and claims of liability for any injury arising out of the design, development, installation, maintenance, operation, and use of a community warning program or community warning system.  Immunity under these provisions does not apply to the management, operation, or maintenance of a community warning system by a donor organization after a donor organization donates a community warning system to a county of the ninth class, except that operation or maintenance of a stationary terminal for communications and operations in accordance with the direction of, or under contract with, a county of the ninth class does not constitute the management, operation, or maintenance of a community warning system.This bill instead would provide that immunity under these provisions does not apply to the management, operation, or maintenance of a community warning system by a donor organization after a donor organization donates a community warning system to a county of the ninth class, but that immunity shall apply to (1) the installation by a donor organization of alert receiver equipment and initiation box equipment, or (2) the operation or maintenance, or both, by a donor organization of stationary terminal equipment and related initiation box equipment, and alert receiver equipment, or both (1) and (2), for communications and operations, provided that the installation, operation, or maintenance, or all of these, by the donor organization is undertaken without compensation, and in accordance with the direction of, or under contract with, a county of the ninth class, whether before or after the donation.Digest KeyBill TextThe people of the State of California do enact as follows:SECTION 1. Section 8655.5 of the Government Code is amended to read:8655.5. (a) As used in this section, the following terms have the following meanings:(1) “Community warning program” means any broadcast or notification program conducted by or at the direction of a public agency of a county of the ninth class that is intended to facilitate the agency’s ability to warn residents of an actual or a threatened hazardous materials release or other emergency or natural disaster, and to coordinate the dissemination of information through various media and other warning devices of any nature, including, but not limited to, sirens, television, radio, 911 service, and public address systems.(2) “Community warning system” means any combination of equipment, hardware, and software used in a community warning program by a county of the ninth class.(3) “Donor organization” means a California nonprofit public benefit corporation, and its officers, directors, employees, members, and contributors, that has donated in whole or in part a community warning system to a county of the ninth class.(b) A donor organization is immune from suit and claims of liability for any injury arising out of the design, development, installation, maintenance, operation, and use of a community warning program or community warning system. This section shall be cumulative with, and does not affect in any way, any immunity from suit and claims of liability, privileges, defenses, or exemptions otherwise enjoyed by any person or entity.  This immunity shall not apply to the management, operation, or maintenance of a community warning system by a donor organization after a donor organization donates a community warning system to a county of the ninth class, but shall apply to (1) the installation by a donor organization of alert receiver equipment and initiation box equipment, or (2) the operation or maintenance, or both, by a donor organization of stationary terminal equipment and related initiation box equipment, and alert receiver equipment, or both (1) and (2), for communications and operations, provided that the installation, operation, or maintenance, or all of these, by the donor organization is undertaken without compensation, and in accordance with the direction of, or under contract with, a county of the ninth class, whether before or after the donation.(c) (1) Except as expressly provided in subdivision (b), this section does not negate or impair any duty or cause of action, whether civil or criminal, against a donor organization.(2) Without limiting the generality of paragraph (1), this section is not intended to, nor shall it be construed to, (A) relieve the manufacturer, designer, developer, installer, or supplier of equipment or software for a community warning system from any obligation or liability under any applicable statute or rule of law, or (B) relieve any donor organization from any liability for the intentional wrongful use of a community warning system or any part thereof.(3) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section or of any law relating to indemnity, joint and several liability, or several liability, no claim for contribution or indemnity arises against a donor organization based on the design, development, installation, maintenance, operation, or use of a community warning system for which the donor organization is otherwise immune under the section.(4) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section or of any law relating to indemnity, joint and several liability, or several liability, no person who is otherwise liable for damages shall be entitled to seek or assert any allocation of any percentage of fault or liability for the purpose of the reduction of damages for personal injury, property damage, or wrongful death, based on the participation of a donor organization or a county of the ninth class or its officials or employees in the design, development, installation, maintenance, operation, or use of a community warning system.
