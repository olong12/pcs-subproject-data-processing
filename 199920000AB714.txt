                          California Gambling Control Commission.(1) Existing law provides that the California Gambling Control Commission, in conjunction with the Division of Gambling Control within the office of the Attorney General, is vested with general regulatory and licensing authority over gambling establishments, and provides that persons seeking to own, or to be employed as key employees within, a gambling establishment, must respectively obtain a gambling license or key employee license, as specified.  Existing law also requires all gambling enterprise employees, as defined, to obtain a work permit, as specified.This bill would exclude maintenance personnel from the definition of “gambling enterprise employee,” thereby allowing these persons to be employed at a gambling establishment without a work permit.(2) Existing law provides that the Gambling Control Commission succeeded to all the powers of the California Gambling Control Board, which was abolished pursuant to the occurrence of specified conditions, and that wherever reference is made to the board within the Gambling Control Act, it shall be construed to mean the commission.This bill would amend a provision referring to the board to instead refer to the commission, thereby making a technical change.  This bill would also reenact, with reference to the commission, a provision that vested the board with general authority to grant, deny, revoke, suspend, or impose conditions, restrictions, or limitations on any license, permit, or approval provided for under the Gambling Control Act.  With regard to this provision, the bill would additionally provide that the commission shall have the authority to reinstate a license to own a gambling establishment, a key employee license, or any other license provided for under the act that has been revoked, suspended, or terminated, provided that the license was not revoked, suspended, or terminated by the division or commission for cause.  The bill would require the commission to adopt regulations implementing this reinstatement authority.(3) Existing law provides that the Director of the Division of Gambling Control and members of the Gambling Control Commission shall receive a specified salary.This bill would instead apply this salary provision to members of the commission only.(4) Existing law requires the commission to establish and appoint a Gaming Policy Advisory Committee of 10 members, comprised equally of representatives of controlled gambling licensees and members of the public, for the purpose of discussing matters of regulatory policy and providing nonbinding advisory recommendations to the commission.The bill would require that the commission establish this committee and appoint 4 representatives of controlled gambling licensees, 3 representatives of local governments that have gambling establishments within their jurisdictions, and one member of the general public.  The bill would also require that the Senate Committee on Rules and the Speaker of the Assembly each appoint one member of the general public.(5) Existing law provides that a person shall be deemed to be unsuitable to hold a state gambling license to own a gambling establishment if the person, or any partner, officer, director, or shareholder of the person, has any financial interest in any business or organization that is engaged in specified types of gambling that are illegal in California, whether within or without this state.This bill would provide that a person shall not be deemed unsuitable to hold a gambling owner’s license under these provisions if that person, or any partner, member, officer, director, or shareholder thereof, holds a financial interest in a publicly traded business or organization engaged in specified types of illegal gambling, whether within or without this state, provided that the total financial interest thereby owned, directly or indirectly, by the person and all the partners, members, officers, directors, and shareholders thereof, taken together, amounts to less than 1% of all the outstanding financial interests of the publicly traded business or organization.This bill would also provide for purposes of these provisions, that an individual shall be deemed to own any financial interest that is owned, directly or indirectly, by that individual’s spouse, siblings, ancestors, or lineal descendants and that an interest that is directly or indirectly owned by or for any business entity or any estate or trust shall be deemed as being proportionately owned by or for the respective shareholders, partners, members, or beneficiaries.(6) Existing law provides for the commission’s adoption of regulations with respect to various matters, including the extension of credit and the cashing, deposit, and redemption of checks by gambling establishments.This bill would delete the reference to regulations governing the extension of credit and the deposit and redemption of checks.This bill would also declare that the public policy of California does not favor the resolution of civil claims through the courts that arise out of gambling losses.  This bill would prohibit gambling establishments from making loans to patrons.  However, this bill would provide that checks accepted by gambling establishments for which cash, tokens, or chips are provided shall be enforced by the courts.(7) This bill would also provide that the Gambling Control Act shall provide the exclusive means for penalizing and bringing disciplinary action against persons duly licensed or otherwise regulated by the act, notwithstanding any other provision of the Business and Professions Code, including provisions that would otherwise apply as general business regulations, and that the administration and enforcement of the act shall be governed solely by provisions in the act and regulations and orders adopted pursuant thereto.(8) Existing law generally provides that all licensed gambling establishments must remain open to the general public, but provides for the licensing of private club gambling establishments in a local jurisdiction until July 1, 2000, or as otherwise specified.  Operation of private club gambling establishments after July 1, 2000, is only permitted if the local jurisdiction approves an ordinance that is approved by the voters that authorizes the operation of gambling establishments that are open to the public.This bill would allow a private club gambling establishment to continue to operate and be licensed after July 1, 2000, if the gambling ordinance of a county provides for the operation of gambling establishments as private clubs and that ordinance was approved in a countywide election.  In that case, the private club would be authorized to operate as long as the current licenseholder owns and operates the club.(9) Existing law provides that if a gambling license is denied by the commission to the individual owner of a security issued by a corporation, then the individual shall immediately offer the security to the issuing corporation for purchase, as specified.This bill would provide that the commission may allow the corporation a period of 90 days to purchase the security if the book value or fair market value of the security exceeds $1,000,000.(10) Existing law requires voter approval of an amendment to a local ordinance that would result in the expansion of gambling, as defined, subject to certain exceptions.  However, this requirement does not apply to a licensed gambling establishment with 5 or fewer tables.This bill would instead provide that the voting approval requirement does not apply to a licensed gambling establishment that claimed the operation of 5 or fewer tables in its initial application, provided that no more than 10 tables are added to the number set forth in that application.Digest KeyBill TextThe people of the State of California do enact as follows:SECTION 1. Section 19805.1 is added to the Business and Professions Code, to read:19805.1. Notwithstanding the definition of “gambling enterprise employee” in Section 19805, “gambling enterprise employee” does not include any maintenance personnel.SEC. 2. Section 19814A of the Business and Professions Code is amended and renumbered to read:19814. The members of the commission shall receive the salary provided for by Section 11553.5 of the Government Code.SEC. 3. Section 19815.5A of the Business and Professions Code is amended and renumbered to read:19815.5. The commission shall establish a Gaming Policy Advisory Committee of 10 members.
