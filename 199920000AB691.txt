              GallegosFebruary 23, 1999An act to amend Section 1357.14 of add Section 1367.25 to the Health and Safety Code, relating to health care coverage.LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 691, as amended, Gallegos.
                          Health care coverage:  small employer health care service plans medical groups:  pharmaceuticals.Existing law, the Moscone-Knox Professional Corporation Act, provides for the formation of a corporation under the General Corporation Law for the purposes of qualifying as a professional corporation that is engaged in rendering professional services in a single profession, and permits a professional corporation to render professional services through persons who are licensed in the profession.This bill would authorize only health care provider organizations, as defined, that meet prescribed conditions to assume any financial risk, as defined, for providing or prescribing for medically necessary pharmaceuticals, including, but not limited to, oral, injectable, intranasal, topical, and rectal agents. Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of health care service plans, administered by the Commissioner of Corporations.  Willful violation of those provisions is a crime. By changing the requirements of health care provider organizations, as defined, the bill would change the definition of a crime applicable to health care service plans, thereby imposing a state-mandated local program.
   The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.Existing law requires health care service plans to make certain disclosures in connection with the offering for sale of any plan contract to a small employer, as part of its solicitation and sales materials.  Existing law requires every solicitor or solicitor firm contracting with one or more plans to solicit enrollments or subscriptions from small employers, when recommending a particular benefit plan design or designs, to advise the small employer that, upon request, the agent will provide the employer with a designated brochure containing the benefit plan design or designs being recommended.This bill would conform this provision to related provisions governing health care service plans by deleting references to benefit plan design and agent and replacing those references with contract plan and solicitor.Digest Key
