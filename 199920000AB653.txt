                LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 653, Hertzberg.
                          Residential mortgage lending.Existing law defines a real estate broker to include persons who solicit borrowers or lenders for or negotiate loans or collect payments or perform services for borrowers or lenders or note owners in connection with loans secured directly or collaterally by liens on real property or on a business opportunity.This bill would exclude from that definition persons employed by a real estate broker who, on behalf of the broker, assist the broker in meeting the broker’s obligations to its customers in residential mortgage loan transactions, where the lender is an institutional lender, provided the employee does not participate in any negotiations between the principals.  It would require a broker to exercise reasonable supervision and control over the activities of these unlicensed employees.The California Residential Mortgage Lending Act regulates the making of residential mortgage loans by specified entities.  Among other things, a residential mortgage lender licensed under the act may provide brokerage services to a borrower, as specified.  A licensee is restricted to a percentage level of brokerage services.This bill would delete that restriction.Existing provisions of the act relative to authorizing brokerage services for borrowers, including a requirement that the Secretary of the Business, Transportation and Housing Agency conduct a study on or before December 31, 1999, on particular matters relating to those services, are to become inoperative June 30, 2001.This bill would change the termination date of these brokerage services provisions to June 30, 2005, thus extending their operation and thereby maintaining the specific provisions requiring the preparation of the study. It would require preparation of an additional report on or before December 31, 2002, as specified.Digest KeyBill TextThe people of the State of California do enact as follows:SECTION 1. Section
