              Rod PachecoFebruary 23, 1999An act to amend Section 667.5 of, and to repeal Section 1170.95 of the Penal Code, relating to sentencing. An act to amend Sections 191.5 and 217.1 of the Penal Code, relating to sentencing.LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 663, as amended, Rod Pacheco.
                          Sentencing.Existing law authorizes the Department of Corrections to reduce a prisoner’s sentence by one-third for good behavior and worktime participation. This credit is required to be applied to reduce the sentence of a person convicted of gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated who has one or more prior convictions for that offense or of other specified offenses, as well as a person convicted of attempted murder of a specified public official in retaliation for or to prevent the performance of the victim’s official duties.This bill would eliminate the requirement to award good behavior and worktime credits to persons convicted under the above 2 provisions.Existing law requires that an increased term of imprisonment of 3 years be imposed upon conviction of a violent felony, as defined, for each separate prior prison term served by the defendant where the prior offense was also one of the specified violent felonies.  A violent felony is defined to include specified offenses including robbery that is perpetrated in specified ways that constitute first degree robbery where it is charged and proved that the defendant personally used a deadly or dangerous weapon, as defined, in the commission of that robbery.This bill would define violent felony under the above enhancement provision, to include any robbery where it is charged and proved that the defendant personally used a deadly or dangerous weapon, as defined, in the commission of that robbery.  The bill would also make conforming changes.  By increasing the punishment for a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
   The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state.  Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.Digest Key
