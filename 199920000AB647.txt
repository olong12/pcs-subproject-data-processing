              AronerFebruary 23, 1999An act to add Section 363.1 to the Public Utilities amend Section 25733 of, and to add Section 6529 to, the Government Code, relating to public resources.LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 647, as amended, Aroner.
                          Upper Mokelumne River Watershed Authority:  powers.Existing(1) Existing law authorizes 2 or more public agencies by agreement to jointly exercise any power common to the contracting parties.A separate body of existing law allows counties to construct, acquire, and develop works for, among other things, the generation of hydroelectric power.Existing law imposes certain restrictions on the sale of power generated acquisition by counties of existing hydroelectric power generation facilities.This bill would entitle all exempt certain public entity members of the Upper Mokelumne River Watershed Authority, a joint powers entity, to carry out the purposes for which the authority is established notwithstanding from the provisions of existing law that impose certain restrictions on the sale acquisition of power generated generation facilities by counties.The bill would provide that no transfer, assignment, or sale of a specified hydroelectric power generation project to the authority is valid unless the Public Utilities Commission has approved that action under terms that the commission finds to be just and reasonable.The bill would require the commission to appraise any associated lands transferred along with the project in accordance with the existing uses of those lands, rather than highest and best use, when those lands are used or could be used primarily for watershed protection purposes and other uses incidental to watershed protection.The bill would require the authority to create a Watershed Improvement Fund and to use the money in that fund to pay for improvements in environmental quality of the Upper Mokelumne River Watershed affected by the project and for certain other purposes specified in the joint powers agreement governing the authority.The bill would require the authority to transfer $5,000,000 to the fund at the time of its acquisition of the project, as specified.  The bill would require the authority to deposit, on an annual basis, 30% of the net surplus revenues from hydroelectric power generation, as specified in the agreement, in the fund.The bill would create a state-mandated local program by imposing additional duties on the authority.
   (2) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement, including the creation of a State Mandates Claims Fund to pay the costs of mandates that do not exceed $1,000,000 statewide and other procedures for claims whose statewide costs exceed $1,000,000.This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.Digest Key
