              Romero)February 23, 1999An act to amend Sections 1279 and 1280 of, and to add Sections 1279.1, 1279.2, and 1280.3 to, the Health and Safety Code, relating to health facilities.LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 675, Thomson.
                          Health facilities:  registered nurses.Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of health facilities by the State Department of Health Services.  Existing law requires that certain health facilities for which a license or special permit has been issued that are certified to participate either in the Medicare program or in the medicaid program, or both, be periodically inspected by a designated inspection team of the department.This bill would require the inspection team to include surveyor staff who have successfully completed an acute care hospital training program that includes a patient classification system module.This bill would require the department to ensure that these periodic inspections are not announced in advance of the date of the inspection.  The bill would authorize the department to conduct joint inspections with other certifying entities but would require that if the department conducts any inspections jointly with any certifying entity that provides notice in advance, the department shall conduct an additional unannounced separate inspection.  The bill would require that periodic inspections be conducted under these provisions no less than once every 3 years and more frequently at the discretion of the department.The bill would require the department to obtain and make available to the public any documents relating to certification for participation in the Medicare program or the medicaid program, or both, unless the disclosure of the documents is expressly prohibited by federal law or state law, as described.  The bill would require the department to obtain and make available to the public documents demonstrating compliance with regulations regarding adequate staffing of health facilities.Existing law requires the department to notify a health facility of all deficiencies in its compliance with provisions governing health facilities and requires the health facility to agree with the department upon a plan of correction that gives the health facility a reasonable time to correct the deficiencies.  Existing law authorizes the director to take action to revoke or suspend the license of the health facility if at the end of the allotted time, as revealed by inspection, the health facility has failed to correct the deficiencies.Existing law designates specific procedures with regard to a general acute care hospital, an acute psychiatric hospital, or a special hospital that fails to implement a plan of correction that has been agreed upon by both the facility and the department or where a condition in the facility poses an immediate and substantial hazard to the health and safety of patients.This bill would revise and recast these provisions regarding the correction of deficiencies at a general acute care hospital, an acute psychiatric hospital, or special hospital.This bill would require certain health facilities to provide sufficient staff to meet the individualized care needs of patients, to implement a patient classification system, to review the system, and to make changes in certain circumstances.Digest KeyBill TextThe people of the State of California do enact as follows:SECTION 1. Section 1279 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to read:1279. (a) Every health facility for which a license or special permit has been issued, except a health facility, as defined in subdivisions (b) to (k), inclusive, of Section 1250, that is certified to participate either in the Medicare program under Title XVIII (42 U.S.C. Sec. 1395 et seq.) of the federal Social Security Act, or in the medicaid program under Title XIX (42 U.S.C. Sec. 1396 et seq.) of the federal Social Security Act, or both, shall be periodically inspected by a representative or representatives appointed by the state department, depending upon the type and complexity of the health facility or special service to be inspected.  If the health facility is deemed to meet standards for certification to participate in either the Medicare program or the medicaid program, or both, because the health facility meets the standards of an agency other than the Health Care Financing Administration, then, in order for the health facility to qualify for the exemption from periodic inspections provided in this section, the inspection to determine that the health facility meets the standards of an agency other than the Health Care Financing Administration shall include participation by the California Medical Association to the same extent as it participated in inspections as provided in Section 1282 prior to the date this section, as amended by SB 1779 of the 1991–92 Regular Session, becomes operative.  Inspections shall be conducted no less than once every two years and as often as necessary to insure the quality of care being provided. However, for a health facility specified in subdivision (a) or (b) of Section 1250, inspections shall be conducted no less than once every three years, and as often as necessary to insure the quality of care being provided.  During the inspection, the representative or representatives shall offer such advice and assistance to the health facility as they deem appropriate.(b) For acute care hospitals of 100 beds or more, the inspection team shall include at least a physician, registered nurse, and persons experienced in hospital administration and sanitary inspections.  During the inspection, the team shall offer such advice and assistance to the hospital as it deems appropriate.  The inspection team shall include surveyor staff who have successfully completed an acute care hospital training program that includes a patient classification system module.  The department shall develop this training module in consultation with a recognized expert or experts in the development of patient classification systems and with acute care hospital provider organizations and collective bargaining unit representatives.(c) The department shall ensure that periodic inspections of compliance with laws and regulations regarding the provision of safe patient care and staffing of facilities, including compliance with the patient classification system, are not announced in advance of the date of the inspection.  Inspections may be conducted jointly with other inspections by other certifying entities.  However, if the department conducts any inspection jointly with any certifying entity that provides notice in advance, the department shall conduct an additional inspection for the purposes of this provision that is unannounced and that is separate from the periodic inspection required by subdivision (a).  Periodic inspections pursuant to this provision shall be conducted no less than once every three years and more frequently at the discretion of the department.SEC. 2. Section 1279.1 is added to the Health and Safety Code, to read:1279.1. (a) The state department shall obtain and make available to the public any documents relating to certification for participation in the Medicare program or the medicaid program, or both, unless the disclosure of the documents is expressly prohibited by federal law or by any state law that protects the confidentiality of information relating to the provision of health care.(b) The state department shall obtain and make available to the public documents demonstrating compliance with regulations regarding adequate staffing of health facilities.SEC. 3. Section 1279.2 is added to the Health and Safety Code, to read:1279.2. (a) Every health care facility licensed pursuant to subdivision (a), (b), or (f) of Section 1250 shall provide sufficient staff to meet the individualized care needs of patients.  Each facility shall implement a patient classification system.(b) The patient classification system shall be based on ongoing patient assessments made by registered nurses.  This assessment shall be performed and documented by a registered nurse at least once per shift and upon receipt of the patient when the patient is transferred from another part of the hospital. Licensed vocational nurses, and licensed psychiatric technicians in facilities operated by the State Department of Mental Health, may participate in the assessment described in this subdivision by performing basic assessment such as data collection, participating in planning, and contributing to the evaluation of individualized interventions related to the care plan or treatment plan to the extent permitted by law.(c) (1) The patient classification system shall include documentation of all of the following:(A) Individual patient assessments.(B) Projections of nursing care staffing needs.(C) Actual nursing care provided.(D) Reports documenting variances between projected staffing needs and actual staff provided.(2) The documentation required under this subdivision shall be retained until the subsequent inspection required under Section 1279.(3) Documentation of the number of licensed nurses, certified nurse’s aides, and other health care personnel projected to be required by the patient classification system shall be made available to the employees in each unit for each shift during that shift.(d) The patient classification system shall be validated at least annually or whenever a change in the system is proposed so that it reliably measures individualized patient care needs and staffing requirements.(e) The patient classification system shall be demonstrated to be understood by the licensed direct care nurses responsible for implementing care on the basis of that system.  Direct care personnel shall have demonstrated competency in the patient classification system appropriate to their role in the provision of care within existing scopes of practice and roles as defined in existing law and regulation.(f) The patient classification system shall ensure that appropriate care is provided by sufficient, appropriately qualified health personnel. Administrative and fiscal considerations shall not result in staffing levels that endanger the life or safety of patients.(g) The patient classification system shall be reviewed annually to ensure continued adequacy of staffing or more frequently if warranted by changes in patient population, skill mix of the staff, or patient care delivery modes.(h) The patient classification system shall provide a mechanism for the administrator of nursing services to review and address concerns raised by direct patient care personnel regarding staffing.(i) The patient classification system shall be reviewed and corrected within 30 days whenever a facility has a deficiency pursuant to Section 1280 relating to staffing.(j) Staffing shall be adjusted daily or more frequently based on the assessed needs of the patients.(k) Changes in the patient classification system shall be validated. Data, including patient mortality, morbidity, nosocomial infections, injuries, and other data indicating potential hazards to patients or workers shall be considered in reviewing changes in the patient classification system.  This subdivision may not be construed to preempt existing state and federal law concerning confidentiality regarding the provision of health care.(l) The facility shall develop and implement policies and protocols that establish mechanisms for rapid deployment of personnel when any labor intensive event occurs that prevents nursing staff from providing attention to all assigned patients, such as an emergency health crisis.  Variations in patient populations and labor intensive events that can be readily foreseen such as seasonal or weekly variations shall not constitute an emergency health crisis for purposes of this section.SEC. 4. Section 1280 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to read:1280. (a) The state department may provide consulting services upon request to any health facility to assist in the identification or correction of deficiencies or the upgrading of the quality of care provided by the health facility.(b) The state department shall notify the health facility of all deficiencies in its compliance with this chapter and the rules and regulations adopted hereunder, and the health facility shall agree with the state department upon a plan of correction that shall give the health facility a reasonable time to correct these deficiencies.  If at the end of the allotted time, as revealed by inspection, the health facility has failed to correct the deficiencies, the director may take action to revoke or suspend the license.(c) (1) If any condition within a health facility licensed under subdivision (a), (b), or (f) of Section 1250 poses an immediate and substantial hazard to the health or safety of patients, the department may order any of the following until the condition is corrected:(A) Reduction in the number of patients.(B) Closure of the unit or units in the facility that pose the risk.  If the unit to be closed is an emergency room in a designated facility, as defined in Section 1797.67, the state department shall notify and coordinate with the local emergency medical services agency.(C) Imposition of a plan of correction proposed by the state department.(D) Civil penalties not to exceed fifty dollars ($50) per patient affected by the hazard for each day that the immediate and substantial hazard continues.(2) The order of the state department pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be in writing and shall contain a statement of the reasons for the order.  If the state department fails to take any of these steps, it shall provide a statement of reasons for the failure to act to protect patients.  The licensee may also propose a more efficient or effective means of remedying the deficiency and the director shall review the information provided by the facility, the state department, and other interested parties and within a reasonable period of time render a decision on alternatives proposed by the facility.(3) If the licensee disputes the order by the state department pursuant to subdivision (a), the licensee may appeal to the director or the director’s designee within 10 days.(d) If the deficiencies do not pose an immediate and substantial hazard to the health or safety of patients, a health facility licensed under subdivision (a), (b), or (f) of Section 1250 shall agree with the state department upon a plan of correction that shall give the health facility a reasonable period of time to correct the deficiencies.  If at the end of a reasonable period of time, the facility has failed to implement fully a plan of correction that has been agreed upon by both the facility and the state department, the state department may order implementation of the plan of correction previously agreed to by both the facility and the state department. If the facility and the state department fail to agree upon a plan of correction within a reasonable period of time, the state department may initiate action to suspend or revoke the facility’s license and the state department shall order implementation of a plan of correction.  The order shall be in writing and shall contain a statement of reasons for the order.(e) Any facility that is cited for a deficiency shall be inspected onsite to ensure correction of the deficiency.  Verbal assurances by representatives of the facility shall not be deemed to be a substitute for the onsite review.  The department may consolidate the onsite inspection with any other facility visit occurring within six months of the citation.(f) If a health facility licensed under subdivision (a), (b), or (f) of Section 1250 is subject to action pursuant to subdivision (c) or if that facility fails to correct deficiencies as provided in subdivision (d), the director may take action to revoke or suspend the facility’s license.(g) Reports on the results of each inspection of a health facility shall be prepared by the inspector or inspector team and shall be kept on file in the state department along with the plan of correction and health facility comments.  The inspection report may include a recommendation for reinspection.  Inspection reports of an intermediate care facility/developmentally disabled habilitative or an intermediate care facility/developmentally disabled—nursing shall be provided by the state department to the appropriate regional center pursuant to Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 4620) of Division 4.5 of the Welfare and Institutions Code.(h) All inspection reports and lists of deficiencies shall be open to public inspection at the state department when the state department has received verification that the health facility has received the report from the state department.  All plans of correction shall be open to public inspection upon receipt by the state department.(i) In no event shall the act of providing a plan of correction, the content of the plan of correction, or the execution of a plan of correction, be used in any legal action or administrative proceeding as an admission within the meaning of Sections 1220 to 1227, inclusive, of the Evidence Code against the health facility, its licensee, or its personnel.SEC. 5. Section 1280.3 is added to the Health and Safety Code, to read:1280.3. (a) In those instances in which the licensee of a health facility licensed under subdivision (a), (b), or (f) of Section 1250 is issued a deficiency pursuant to Section 1280 for violations related to the patient classification system as defined in Section 1279.2, the department may, in writing, do either of the following:(1) Order implementation of the plan of correction if the hospital fails to implement the plan of correction agreed to by the facility and the state department.(2) Assess a civil penalty not to exceed fifty dollars ($50) per day per patient affected if the hospital and the department fail to agree on a plan of correction in a timely manner.(b) The licensee may, within 10 days, request a review of decisions reached by the director pursuant to subdivision (a).  If the licensee disputes an order by the department pursuant to subdivision (a), the licensee may appeal to the director or the director’s designee within 10 days.
