              CardozaFebruary 23, 1999An act to add Section 19304 to the Food and Agricultural Code, relating to rendering plants, making an appropriation therefor.LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 654, as amended, Cardoza.
                          Rendering plant:  odor.Existing law requires a person engaged in the business of rendering to obtain a license for each rendering plant.  Existing law also prohibits a local government, after January 1, 2000, from bringing a nuisance action against a licensed commercial rendering plant due to odor problems if that rendering plant meets specified conditions, unless the odor problem is the result of a substantial increase in activities or operations, occurring after January 1, 1993, that has a significant effect on the environment.This bill would require the Department of Food and Agriculture to conduct a study to determine odor level using particulate or gaseous levels for rendering plants that are within 1/2 mile of a school.  “School” would be defined to mean K–12 public schools.  The bill would require the department to report to the Legislature by June 1, 2001.  The bill would also appropriate $50,000 to the department to conduct the study.Digest Key
