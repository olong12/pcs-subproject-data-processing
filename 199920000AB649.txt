                LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 649, Machado.
                          State employees.(1) Under existing law, members of the Defined Benefit Program of the State Teachers’ Retirement Plan who become employed by any of a list of other public employers to perform service that requires membership in a different public retirement system, may elect to be excluded from membership in that different system and continue to have their service subject to their existing system.This bill would make this election available to members of the State Teachers’ Retirement System who became employed by the state, during a specified period, to perform service subject to Second Tier benefits in the Public Employees’ Retirement System and who satisfy certain requirements.  The bill would require persons making that election to make specified contributions to the Teachers’ Retirement Fund with respect to their pre-election state service and would also require specified assets to be transferred from the Public Employees’ Retirement System to that fund on account of that state service, thereby making an appropriation to the Teachers’ Retirement Fund, a continuously appropriated fund.(2) Under existing law, members of the Defined Benefit Program of the State Teachers’ Retirement Plan are entitled to service credit at service retirement for accumulated and unused leave of absence for illness or injury, as specified.This bill would provide that members who are eligible state employees and who retire on or after January 1, 2000, shall receive, subject to the terms of a memorandum of understanding or the authorization of the Department of Personnel Administration, service credit at service retirement for accumulated unused leave of absence for education, as specified.(3) Existing law includes procedures for disciplining state employees, including State Personnel Board investigations and hearings, the review of administrative decisions, and suspensions.This bill would provide that certain of these procedures do not apply to state employees in State Bargaining Unit 11 who have been disciplined for positive drug test results and who expressly waive appeal to the State Personnel Board and invoke arbitration proceedings pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement.  The bill would require the state employer, if the collective bargaining agreement has expired and an answer has been filed, to follow the appeal procedures contained in the expired memorandum of understanding for state employees in State Bargaining Unit 11 until a successor agreement is negotiated.(4) Existing law, the Public Employees’ Retirement Law, establishes the Public Employees’ Retirement System, and sets forth the provisions for its administration and the delivery of benefits to its members.  Member contributions to the Public Employees’ Retirement System are deposited into the Public Employees’ Retirement Fund, which is a continuously appropriated fund.  Existing law includes in the state safety membership category state employees in state bargaining units that have agreed in a memorandum of understanding between the state employer and the recognized employee organization that the classifications or positions of these state employees are found to meet specified state safety membership criteria, if the Department of Personnel Administration has agreed to their inclusion. Existing law excludes from the state peace officer/firefighter membership category security officers employed by the Department of Justice.This bill would include state employees excluded from the Ralph C. Dills Act and officers or employees of the executive branch of state government who are not members of the civil service within the classification of state safety members, if the department has approved their inclusion, and would delete the exclusion of security officers employed by the Department of Justice from the classification of state peace officer/firefighter members.  To the extent the bill would enlarge the class of persons eligible for state safety or state peace officer/firefighter membership, it would make an appropriation by increasing the amount of contributions to the Public Employees’ Retirement Fund.(5) Existing law establishes the Rural Health Care Equity Trust Fund, which is administered by the Department of Personnel Administration to provide subsidies and reimbursements for certain health care premiums and health care costs incurred by state employees and annuitants in rural areas on or after January 1, 2000.  The fund ceases to be operative on January 1, 2005, or earlier, as specified.  Existing law requires each fund in the State Treasury to reimburse the General Fund for specified contributions to the Rural Health Care Equity Trust Fund for the employees and annuitants paid from each fund.This bill would change references to the fund to the Rural Health Care Equity Program and specify the means by which the General Fund reimbursements are to be made.(6) Existing law, the Public Employees’ Retirement Law, provides increased industrial disability retirement benefits for certain state membership categories who are incapacitated for the performance of their present duties as a result of injury or illness arising out of and in the course of their employment on or after January 1, 1993.This bill would provide that these provisions do not apply to a job-related or job-incurred illness or injury that occurs on or after January 1, 2000. The bill would declare the intent of the Legislature that these provisions be given retroactive effect to January 1, 2000.(7) Under the Public Employees’ Retirement Law, specified officers and employees of the State Department of Mental Health are classified as state safety members, however, those members have the option to irrevocably elect, within a specified time period, to remain subject to the miscellaneous membership classification.This bill would provide that a specified group of those officers and employees who elected to remain subject to the miscellaneous membership classification shall have the right to elect to become safety members, as specified.(8) Existing law, the Public Employees’ Medical and Hospital Care Act, provides health benefits plan coverage to public employees and annuitants meeting the eligibility requirements prescribed by the Board of Administration of the Public Employees’ Retirement System.This bill would revise the definition of “eligible employees” for the purposes of the act to delete a definition applicable only to state employees in State Bargaining Unit 19.(9) Existing law, with specified exceptions, provides that all contracts entered into by any state agency for the hiring or purchase of goods and services, including equipment, supplies, textbooks, and repair or maintenance, are void unless approved by the Department of General Services.  Contracts entered into by the Department of Personnel Administration for employee benefits, occupational health and safety, training services, or any combination thereof, for state employees in state bargaining units that have agreed to this exemption in a memorandum of understanding are exempt from this approval requirement.This bill would revise this provision to make it applicable to all contracts, with specified exceptions, entered into by any state agency for the acquisition of goods and services.  The bill would expand the exemption for contracts entered into by the Department of Personnel Administration for employee benefits, occupational health and safety, training services, and any combination thereof, for state employees, as specified.(10) This bill would appropriate $65,414,288 from the General Fund and unallocated special funds, in specified amounts, for allocation for various state employee benefits or programs, including state employee compensation, the Work and Family Fund, and the Rural Area Health Subsidy Program.(11) This bill would incorporate additional changes in Section 10295 of the Public Contract Code proposed by AB 1441, to become operative if both this bill and AB 1441 are enacted and become effective on or before January 1, 2001, and this bill is enacted last.
   (12) This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.Digest Key
      Appropriation:
      YES  Bill TextThe people of the State of California do enact as follows:SECTION 1. Section 1094.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure is amended to read:1094.5. (a) Where the writ is issued for the purpose of inquiring into the validity of any final administrative order or decision made as the result of a proceeding in which by law a hearing is required to be given, evidence is required to be taken, and discretion in the determination of facts is vested in the inferior tribunal, corporation, board, or officer, the case shall be heard by the court sitting without a jury.  All or part of the record of the proceedings before the inferior tribunal, corporation, board, or officer may be filed with the petition, may be filed with respondent’s points and authorities, or may be ordered to be filed by the court.  Except when otherwise prescribed by statute, the cost of preparing the record shall be borne by the petitioner.  Where the petitioner has proceeded pursuant to Section 68511.3 of the Government Code and the Rules of Court implementing that section and where the transcript is necessary to a proper review of the administrative proceedings, the cost of preparing the transcript shall be borne by the respondent.  Where the party seeking the writ has proceeded pursuant to Section 1088.5, the administrative record shall be filed as expeditiously as possible, and may be filed with the petition, or by the respondent after payment of the costs by the petitioner, where required, or as otherwise directed by the court.  If the expense of preparing all or any part of the record has been borne by the prevailing party, the expense shall be taxable as costs.(b) The inquiry in such a case shall extend to the questions whether the respondent has proceeded without, or in excess of jurisdiction; whether there was a fair trial; and whether there was any prejudicial abuse of discretion. Abuse of discretion is established if the respondent has not proceeded in the manner required by law, the order or decision is not supported by the findings, or the findings are not supported by the evidence.(c) Where it is claimed that the findings are not supported by the evidence, in cases in which the court is authorized by law to exercise its independent judgment on the evidence, abuse of discretion is established if the court determines that the findings are not supported by the weight of the evidence.  In all other cases, abuse of discretion is established if the court determines that the findings are not supported by substantial evidence in the light of the whole record.(d) Notwithstanding subdivision (c), in cases arising from private hospital boards or boards of directors of districts organized pursuant to The Local Hospital District Law, Division 23 (commencing with Section 32000) of the Health and Safety Code or governing bodies of municipal hospitals formed pursuant to Article 7 (commencing with Section 37600) or Article 8 (commencing with Section 37650) of Chapter 5 of Division 3 of Title 4 of the Government Code, abuse of discretion is established if the court determines that the findings are not supported by substantial evidence in the light of the whole record.  However, in all cases in which the petition alleges discriminatory actions prohibited by Section 1316 of the Health and Safety Code, and the plaintiff makes a preliminary showing of substantial evidence in support of that allegation, the court shall exercise its independent judgment on the evidence and abuse of discretion shall be established if the court determines that the findings are not supported by the weight of the evidence.(e) Where the court finds that there is relevant evidence that, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, could not have been produced or that was improperly excluded at the hearing before respondent, it may enter judgment as provided in subdivision (f) remanding the case to be reconsidered in the light of that evidence; or, in cases in which the court is authorized by law to exercise its independent judgment on the evidence, the court may admit the evidence at the hearing on the writ without remanding the case.(f) The court shall enter judgment either commanding respondent to set aside the order or decision, or denying the writ.  Where the judgment commands that the order or decision be set aside, it may order the reconsideration of the case in the light of the court’s opinion and judgment and may order respondent to take such further action as is specially enjoined upon it by law, but the judgment shall not limit or control in any way the discretion legally vested in the respondent.(g) Except as provided in subdivision (h), the court in which proceedings under this section are instituted may stay the operation of the administrative order or decision pending the judgment of the court, or until the filing of a notice of appeal from the judgment or until the expiration of the time for filing the notice, whichever occurs first.  However, no such stay shall be imposed or continued if the court is satisfied that it is against the public interest.  The application for the stay shall be accompanied by proof of service of a copy of the application on the respondent.  Service shall be made in the manner provided by Title 5 (commencing with Section 405) of Part 2 or Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 1010) of Title 14 of Part 2.  If an appeal is taken from a denial of the writ, the order or decision of the agency shall not be stayed except upon the order of the court to which the appeal is taken. However, in cases where a stay is in effect at the time of filing the notice of appeal, the stay shall be continued by operation of law for a period of 20 days from the filing of the notice.  If an appeal is taken from the granting of the writ, the order or decision of the agency is stayed pending the determination of the appeal unless the court to which the appeal is taken shall otherwise order.  Where any final administrative order or decision is the subject of proceedings under this section, if the petition shall have been filed while the penalty imposed is in full force and effect, the determination shall not be considered to have become moot in cases where the penalty imposed by the administrative agency has been completed or complied with during the pendency of the proceedings.(h) (1) The court in which proceedings under this section are instituted may stay the operation of the administrative order or decision of any licensed hospital or any state agency made after a hearing required by statute to be conducted under the Administrative Procedure Act, as set forth in Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 11500) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code, conducted by the agency itself or an administrative law judge on the staff of the Office of Administrative Hearings pending the judgment of the court, or until the filing of a notice of appeal from the judgment or until the expiration of the time for filing the notice, whichever occurs first.  However, the stay shall not be imposed or continued unless the court is satisfied that the public interest will not suffer and that the licensed hospital or agency is unlikely to prevail ultimately on the merits. The application for the stay shall be accompanied by proof of service of a copy of the application on the respondent.  Service shall be made in the manner provided by Title 5 (commencing with Section 405) of Part 2 or Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 1010) of Title 14 of Part 2.(2) The standard set forth in this subdivision for obtaining a stay shall apply to any administrative order or decision of an agency that issues licenses pursuant to Division 2 (commencing with Section 500) of the Business and Professions Code or pursuant to the Osteopathic Initiative Act or the Chiropractic Initiative Act.  With respect to orders or decisions of other state agencies, the standard in this subdivision shall apply only when the agency has adopted the proposed decision of the administrative law judge in its entirety or has adopted the proposed decision but reduced the proposed penalty pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 11517 of the Government Code; otherwise the standard in subdivision (g) shall apply.(3) If an appeal is taken from a denial of the writ, the order or decision of the hospital or agency shall not be stayed except upon the order of the court to which the appeal is taken.  However, in cases where a stay is in effect at the time of filing the notice of appeal, the stay shall be continued by operation of law for a period of 20 days from the filing of the notice. If an appeal is taken from the granting of the writ, the order or decision of the hospital or agency is stayed pending the determination of the appeal unless the court to which the appeal is taken shall otherwise order. Where any final administrative order or decision is the subject of proceedings under this section, if the petition shall have been filed while the penalty imposed is in full force and effect, the determination shall not be considered to have become moot in cases where the penalty imposed by the administrative agency has been completed or complied with during the pendency of the proceedings.(i) Any administrative record received for filing by the clerk of the court may be disposed of as provided in Sections 1952, 1952.2, and 1952.3.(j) Effective January 1, 1996, this subdivision shall apply to state employees in State Bargaining Unit 5.
