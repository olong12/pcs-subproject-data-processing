              HaviceFebruary 23, 1999An act to amend Section 667.5 of the Penal Code, relating to sentencing.LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 672, as introduced, Havice.
                          Sentencing:  violent felonies.Existing law requires the court, where the defendant’s current conviction is for a “violent felony,” to impose a 3-year sentence enhancement for each prior separate prison term served by the defendant if the prior term was for a “violent felony.”  “Violent felony” is defined to include, among other things, specified types of kidnapping.This bill would revise the definition of “violent felony” for these purposes to include any kidnapping.
   The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state.  Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.Digest Key
