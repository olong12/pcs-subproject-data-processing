              CorbettFebruary 24, 1999An act to add Section 1375.2 to the Health and Safety Code, relating to health care.LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 698, as amended, Corbett.
                          Health care service plans.Existing law requires a health care service plan to have a fiscally sound operation and adequate provision against the risk of insolvency.  The willful violation of these provisions is a crime.This bill would require the Commissioner of Corporations to establish a system to enable a health care service plan contracting with a risk-bearing provider organization, as defined, to meet the plan’s obligation to ensure the financial soundness of its arrangements for health care services, as specified.  Among other things, the commissioner would be required to establish an Office of Plan-Provider Oversight, that would implement these requirements. contracting with a health service plan to file with the contracting health care service plan the opinion of a certified public accounting firm or a private, nonprofit accrediting organization regarding the financial solvency of the risk-bearing provider organization.  The bill would require a risk-bearing provider organization to meet various other requirements related to filing an annual financial statement with the commissioner and submitting a corrective action plan if the organization fails to meet certain requirements.  The bill would set forth additional duties of the commissioner.The bill would require a health care service plan to cooperate in establishing a mutually agreed upon written corrective plan as provided under the bill.  The bill would require a health care service plan that has an agreement with a provider organization to report certain information, to report that information at least quarterly in the manner specified in the bill.By imposing new requirements on health care service plans, this bill would change the definition of a crime, thereby imposing a state-mandated local program. 
   The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.Digest Key
