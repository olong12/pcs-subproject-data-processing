                          Youth Authority.Existing law, the Youth Authority Act, governs the commitment of juvenile offenders to the Department of the Youth Authority.  The act states that the purpose of those provisions is to protect society from the consequences of criminal activity and, to that end, training and treatment shall be substituted for retributive punishment.This bill would revise that statement to provide that community restoration, victim restoration, and offender training and treatment shall be substituted for retributive punishment.Digest KeyBill TextThe people of the State of California do enact as follows:SECTION 1. Section 1700 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:1700. The purpose of this chapter is to protect society from the consequences of criminal activity and to that purpose community restoration, victim restoration, and offender training and treatment shall be substituted for retributive punishment and shall be directed toward the correction and rehabilitation of young persons who have committed public offenses.
