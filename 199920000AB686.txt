                LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 686, Aroner.
                          Dependent children:  termination of jurisdiction.(1) Existing law provides that a child who has been abused or neglected may be adjudged a dependent child of the juvenile court.  Existing law specifies procedures for terminating that jurisdiction.This bill would require the county welfare department to ensure that the child is present in court at any hearing to terminate jurisdiction over that child, unless the child does not wish to appear or cannot be located, as specified.  The bill also would require the department to submit a report verifying that specified information, documents, and services have been provided to the child.  The bill would also authorize the court to continue jurisdiction if the court finds that the county welfare department has not provided the information, documents, and services, and that termination of jurisdiction would be harmful to the child’s best interests, as specified. The bill would require the Judicial Council to develop and implement standards, and to develop and adopt forms for purposes of these provisions. By imposing new duties on local employees, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.(2) Existing law authorizes the juvenile court to direct any and all reasonable orders to the parents or guardians of a child who is the subject of dependency proceedings or a minor who is the subject of delinquency proceedings that the court deems necessary and proper, as specified.This bill would revise those provisions to specifically authorize the court to direct the parents or guardians to ensure the child’s or the minor’s regular school attendance and to make reasonable efforts to obtain appropriate educational services necessary to meet the needs of the child or the minor.
   (3) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement, including the creation of a State Mandates Claims Fund to pay the costs of mandates that do not exceed $1,000,000 statewide and other procedures for claims whose statewide costs exceed $1,000,000.This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.Digest KeyBill TextThe people of the State of California do enact as follows:SECTION 1. Section 362 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:362. (a) When a child is adjudged a dependent child of the court on the ground that the child is a person described by Section 300, the court may make any and all reasonable orders for the care, supervision, custody, conduct, maintenance, and support of the child, including medical treatment, subject to further order of the court.  To facilitate coordination and cooperation among government agencies, the court may, after giving notice and an opportunity to be heard, join in the juvenile court proceedings any agency that the court determines has failed to meet a legal obligation to provide services to the child.  In any proceeding in which an agency is joined, the court shall not impose duties upon the agency beyond those mandated by law. Nothing in this section shall prohibit agencies which have received notice of the hearing on joinder from meeting prior to the hearing to coordinate services for the child.The court has no authority to order services unless it has been determined through the administrative process of an agency that has been joined as a party, that the child is eligible for those services.  With respect to mental health assessment, treatment, and case management services pursuant to Chapter 26.5 (commencing with Section 7570) of Division 7 of Title 1 of the Government Code, the court’s determination shall be limited to whether the agency has complied with that chapter.(b) When a child is adjudged a dependent child of the court, on the ground that the child is a person described by Section 300 and the court orders that a parent or guardian shall retain custody of the child subject to the supervision of the social worker, the parents or guardians shall be required to participate in child welfare services or services provided by an appropriate agency designated by the court.(c) The juvenile court may direct any and all reasonable orders to the parents or guardians of the child who is the subject of any proceedings under this chapter as the court deems necessary and proper to carry out the provisions of this section, including orders to appear before a county financial evaluation officer.  That order may include a direction to participate in a counseling or education program, including, but not limited to, a parent education and parenting program operated by a community college, school district, or other appropriate agency designated by the court.  A foster parent or relative with whom the child is placed may be directed to participate in such a program in cases in which the court deems participation is appropriate and in the child’s best interest.  The program in which a parent or guardian is required to participate shall be designed to eliminate those conditions that led to the court’s finding that the child is a person described by Section 300.(d) When a child is adjudged a dependent child of the court, the juvenile court may direct any and all reasonable orders to the parents or guardians of the child who is the subject of any proceedings under this chapter, to ensure the child’s regular school attendance and to make reasonable efforts to obtain educational services necessary to meet the specific needs of the child.SEC. 1.5. Section 362 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:362. (a) When a child is adjudged a dependent child of the court on the ground that the child is a person described by Section 300, the court may make any and all reasonable orders for the care, supervision, custody, conduct, maintenance, and support of the child, including medical treatment, subject to further order of the court.  To facilitate coordination and cooperation among government agencies or private service providers, or both, the court may, after giving notice and an opportunity to be heard, join in the juvenile court proceedings any agency or private service provider that the court determines has failed to meet a legal obligation to provide services to the child.  In any proceeding in which an agency or private service provider is joined, the court shall not impose duties upon the agency or private service provider beyond those mandated by law.  Nothing in this section shall prohibit agencies or private service providers that have received notice of the hearing on joinder from meeting prior to the hearing to coordinate services for the child.The court has no authority to order services unless it has been determined through the administrative process of an agency that has been joined as a party, that the child is eligible for those services.  With respect to mental health assessment, treatment, and case management services pursuant to Chapter 26.5 (commencing with Section 7570) of Division 7 of Title 1 of the Government Code, the court’s determination shall be limited to whether the agency or private service provider has complied with that chapter.(b) When a child is adjudged a dependent child of the court, on the ground that the child is a person described by Section 300 and the court orders that a parent or guardian shall retain custody of the child subject to the supervision of the social worker, the parents or guardians shall be required to participate in child welfare services or services provided by an appropriate agency designated by the court.(c) The juvenile court may direct any and all reasonable orders to the parents or guardians of the child who is the subject of any proceedings under this chapter as the court deems necessary and proper to carry out the provisions of this section, including orders to appear before a county financial evaluation officer.  That order may include a direction to participate in a counseling or education program, including, but not limited to, a parent education and parenting program operated by a community college, school district, or other appropriate agency designated by the court.  A foster parent or relative with whom the child is placed may be directed to participate in such a program in cases in which the court deems participation is appropriate and in the child’s best interest.  The program in which a parent or guardian is required to participate shall be designed to eliminate those conditions that led to the court’s finding that the child is a person described by Section 300.(d) When a child is adjudged a dependent child of the court, the juvenile court may direct any and all reasonable orders to the parents or guardians of the child who is the subject of any proceedings under this chapter, to ensure the child’s regular school attendance and to make reasonable efforts to obtain educational services necessary to meet the specific needs of the child.(e) “Private service provider” means any agency or individual that receives federal, state, or local government funding or reimbursement for providing services directly to foster children.SEC. 2. Section 366.3 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:366.3. (a) If a juvenile court orders a permanent plan of adoption or legal guardianship pursuant to Section 360 or 366.26, the court shall retain jurisdiction over the child until the child is adopted or the legal guardianship is established.  The status of the child shall be reviewed every six months to ensure that the adoption or guardianship is completed as expeditiously as possible.  When the adoption of the child has been granted, the court shall terminate its jurisdiction over the child.  Following establishment of a legal guardianship, the court may continue jurisdiction over the child as a dependent child of the juvenile court following the establishment of a legal guardianship or may terminate its dependency jurisdiction and retain jurisdiction over the child as a ward of the guardianship, as authorized by Section 366.4.  If, however, a relative of the child is appointed the legal guardian of the child and the child has been placed with the relative for at least 12 months, the court shall, except where the relative guardian objects, or upon a finding of exceptional circumstances, terminate its dependency jurisdiction and retain jurisdiction over the child as a ward of the guardianship, as authorized by Section 366.4.  Following a termination of parental rights the parent or parents shall not be a party to, or receive notice of, any subsequent proceedings regarding the child.(b) If the court has dismissed dependency jurisdiction following the establishment of a legal guardianship, or no dependency jurisdiction attached because of the granting of a legal guardianship pursuant to Section 360, and the legal guardianship is subsequently revoked or otherwise terminated, the county department of social services or welfare department shall notify the juvenile court of this fact.  The court may vacate its previous order dismissing dependency jurisdiction over the child.Notwithstanding Section 1601 of the Probate Code, the proceedings to terminate a guardianship which has been granted pursuant to Section 360 or 366.26 shall be held in the juvenile court, unless the termination is due to the emancipation or adoption of the child.  Prior to the hearing on a petition to terminate guardianship pursuant to this paragraph, the court shall order the county department of social services or welfare department to prepare a report, for the court’s consideration, that shall include an evaluation of whether the child could safely remain in the guardian’s home, without terminating the guardianship, if services were provided to the child or guardian.  If applicable, the report shall also identify recommended services to maintain the guardianship and set forth a plan for providing those services.  If the petition to terminate guardianship is granted, the juvenile court may resume dependency jurisdiction over the child, and may order the county department of social services or welfare department to develop a new permanent plan, which shall be presented to the court within 60 days of the termination.  If no dependency jurisdiction has attached, the social worker shall make any investigation he or she deems necessary to determine whether the child may be within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court, as provided in Section 328.Unless the parental rights of the child’s parent or parents have been terminated, they shall be notified that the guardianship has been revoked or terminated and shall be entitled to participate in the new permanency planning hearing.  The court shall try to place the child in another permanent placement.  At the hearing, the parents may be considered as custodians but the child shall not be returned to the parent or parents unless they prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that reunification is the best alternative for the child.  The court may, if it is in the best interests of the child, order that reunification services again be provided to the parent or parents.(c) If, following the establishment of a legal guardianship, the county welfare department becomes aware of changed circumstances that indicate adoption may be an appropriate plan for the child, the department shall so notify the court.  The court may vacate its previous order dismissing dependency jurisdiction over the child and order that a hearing be held pursuant to Section 366.26 to determine whether adoption or continued guardianship is the most appropriate plan for the child.  The hearing shall be held no later than 120 days from the date of the order.  Whenever the court orders that a hearing shall be held pursuant to Section 366.26, the court shall direct the agency supervising the child and the licensed county adoption agency, or the State Department of Social Services when it is acting as an adoption agency in counties that are not served by a county adoption agency, to prepare an assessment under subdivision (b) of Section 366.22.(d) If the child is in a placement other than the home of a legal guardian and jurisdiction has not been dismissed, the status of the child shall be reviewed at least every six months.  The review of the status of a child for whom the court has ordered parental rights terminated and who has been ordered placed for adoption shall be conducted by the court.  The review of the status of a child for whom the court has not ordered parental rights terminated and who has not been ordered placed for adoption may be conducted by the court or an appropriate local agency.  The court shall conduct the review under the following circumstances:(1) Upon the request of the child’s parents or guardians.(2) Upon the request of the child.(3) It has been 12 months since a hearing held pursuant to Section 366.26 or an order that the minor remain in long-term foster care pursuant to Section 366.21, 366.22, 366.26, or subdivision (g).(4) It has been 12 months since a review was conducted by the court.The court shall determine whether or not reasonable efforts to make and finalize a permanent placement for the child have been made.(e) Except as provided in subdivision (f), at the review held every six months pursuant to subdivision (d), the reviewing body shall inquire about the progress being made to provide a permanent home for the child, shall consider the safety of the child, and shall determine all of the following:(1) The continuing necessity for and appropriateness of the placement.(2) The continuing appropriateness and extent of compliance with the permanent plan for the child.(3) The extent of the agency’s compliance with the child welfare services case plan in making reasonable efforts to return the child to a safe home and to complete whatever steps are necessary to finalize the permanent placement of the child.(4) The adequacy of services provided to the child.  The court shall consider the progress in providing the information and documents to the child, as described in Section 391.  The court shall also consider the need for, and progress in providing, the assistance and services described in paragraphs (3) and (4) of subdivision (b) of Section 391.(5) The extent of progress the parents have made toward alleviating or mitigating the causes necessitating placement in foster care.(6) The likely date by which the child may be returned to and safely maintained in the home, placed for adoption, legal guardianship, or in another planned permanent living arrangement.(7) For a child who is 16 years of age or older, the services needed to assist the child to make the transition from foster care to independent living.The reviewing body shall determine whether or not reasonable efforts to make and finalize a permanent placement for the child have been made.Each licensed foster family agency shall submit reports for each child in its care, custody, and control to the court concerning the continuing appropriateness and extent of compliance with the child’s permanent plan, the extent of compliance with the case plan, and the type and adequacy of services provided to the child.Unless their parental rights have been permanently terminated, the parent or parents of the child are entitled to receive notice of, and participate in, those hearings.  It shall be presumed that continued care is in the best interests of the child, unless the parent or parents prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that further efforts at reunification are the best alternative for the child.  In those cases, the court may order that further reunification services to return the child to a safe home environment be provided to the parent or parents for a period not to exceed six months.(f) At the review conducted by the court and held at least every six months, regarding a child for whom the court has ordered parental rights terminated and who has been ordered placed for adoption, the county welfare department shall prepare and present to the court a report describing the following:(1) The child’s present placement.(2) The child’s current physical, mental, emotional, and educational status.(3) Whether the child has been placed with a prospective adoptive parent or parents.(4) Whether an adoptive placement agreement has been signed and filed.(5) The progress of the search for an adoptive placement if one has not been identified.(6) Any impediments to the adoption or the adoptive placement.(7) The anticipated date by which the child will be adopted, or placed in an adoptive home.(8) The anticipated date by which an adoptive placement agreement will be signed.(9) Recommendations for court orders that will assist in the placement of the child for adoption or in the finalization of the adoption.The court shall determine whether or not reasonable efforts to make and finalize a permanent placement for the child have been made.The court shall make appropriate orders to protect the stability of the child and to facilitate and expedite the permanent placement and adoption of the child.(g) At the review held pursuant to subdivision (d) for a child in long-term foster care, the court shall consider all permanency planning options for the child including whether the child should be returned to the home of the parent, placed for adoption, or appointed a legal guardian, or whether the child should remain in long-term foster care.  The court shall order that a hearing be held pursuant to Section 366.26 unless it determines by clear and convincing evidence, that there is a compelling reason for determining that a hearing held pursuant to Section 366.26 is not in the best interest of the child because the child is being returned to the home of the parent, the child is not a proper subject for adoption, or no one is willing to accept legal guardianship.  If the licensed adoption agency, or the department when it is acting as an adoption agency, has determined it is unlikely that the child will be adopted or one of the conditions described in paragraph (1) of subdivision (c) of Section 366.26 applies, that fact shall constitute a compelling reason for purposes of this subdivision.  Only upon that determination may the court order that the child remain in long-term foster care, without holding a hearing pursuant to Section 366.26.(h) If, as authorized by subdivision (g), the court orders a hearing pursuant to Section 366.26, the court shall direct the agency supervising the child and the licensed county adoption agency, or the State Department of Social Services when it is acting as an adoption agency in counties that are not served by a county adoption agency, to prepare an assessment as provided for in subdivision (i) of Section 366.21 or subdivision (b) of Section 366.22. A hearing held pursuant to Section 366.26 shall be held no later than 120 days from the date of the 12-month review at which it is ordered, and at that hearing the court shall determine whether adoption, guardianship, or long-term foster care is the most appropriate plan for the child.SEC. 2.1. Section 366.3 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:366.3. (a) If a juvenile court orders a permanent plan of adoption or legal guardianship pursuant to Section 360 or 366.26, the court shall retain jurisdiction over the child until the child is adopted or the legal guardianship is established.  The status of the child shall be reviewed every six months to ensure that the adoption or guardianship is completed as expeditiously as possible.  When the adoption of the child has been granted, the court shall terminate its jurisdiction over the child.  Following establishment of a legal guardianship, the court may continue jurisdiction over the child as a dependent child of the juvenile court following the establishment of a legal guardianship or may terminate its dependency jurisdiction and retain jurisdiction over the child as a ward of the guardianship, as authorized by Section 366.4.  If, however, a relative of the child is appointed the legal guardian of the child and the child has been placed with the relative for at least 12 months, the court shall, except where the relative guardian objects, or upon a finding of exceptional circumstances, terminate its dependency jurisdiction and retain jurisdiction over the child as a ward of the guardianship, as authorized by Section 366.4.  Following a termination of parental rights the parent or parents shall not be a party to, or receive notice of, any subsequent proceedings regarding the child.(b) If the court has dismissed dependency jurisdiction following the establishment of a legal guardianship, or no dependency jurisdiction attached because of the granting of a legal guardianship pursuant to Section 360, and the legal guardianship is subsequently revoked or otherwise terminated, the county department of social services or welfare department shall notify the juvenile court of this fact.  The court may vacate its previous order dismissing dependency jurisdiction over the child.Notwithstanding Section 1601 of the Probate Code, the proceedings to terminate a guardianship which has been granted pursuant to Section 360 or 366.26 shall be held in the juvenile court, unless the termination is due to the emancipation or adoption of the child.

The review of the status of a child for whom the court has ordered parental rights terminated and who has been ordered placed for adoption shall be conducted by the court.  The review of the status of a child for whom the court has not ordered parental rights terminated and who has not been ordered placed for adoption may be conducted by the court or an appropriate local agency.  The court shall conduct the review under the following circumstances:(1) Upon the request of the child’s parents or guardians.(2) Upon the request of the child.(3) It has been 12 months since a hearing held pursuant to Section 366.26 or an order that the minor remain in long-term foster care pursuant to Section 366.21, 366.22, 366.26, or subdivision (g).(4) It has been 12 months since a review was conducted by the court.The court shall determine whether or not reasonable efforts to make and finalize a permanent placement for the child have been made.(e) Except as provided in subdivision (f), at the review held every six months pursuant to subdivision (d), the reviewing body shall inquire about the progress being made to provide a permanent home for the child, shall consider the safety of the child, and shall determine all of the following:(1) The continuing necessity for and appropriateness of the placement.(2) The continuing appropriateness and extent of compliance with the permanent plan for the child.(3) The extent of the agency’s compliance with the child welfare services case plan in making reasonable efforts to return the child to a safe home and to complete whatever steps are necessary to finalize the permanent placement of the child.(4) The adequacy of services provided to the child.

A hearing held pursuant to Section 366.26 shall be held no later than 120 days from the date of the 12-month review at which it is ordered, and at that hearing the court shall determine whether adoption, guardianship, or long-term foster care is the most appropriate plan for the child.SEC. 2.2. Section 366.3 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:366.3. (a) If a juvenile court orders a permanent plan of adoption or legal guardianship pursuant to Section 360 or 366.26, the court shall retain jurisdiction over the child until the child is adopted or the legal guardianship is established.  The status of the child shall be reviewed every six months to ensure that the adoption or legal guardianship is completed as expeditiously as possible.

If the petition to terminate legal guardianship is granted, the juvenile court may resume dependency jurisdiction over the child, and may order the county department of social services or welfare department to develop a new permanent plan, which shall be presented to the court within 60 days of the termination.  If no dependency jurisdiction has attached, the social worker shall make any investigation he or she deems necessary to determine whether the child may be within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court, as provided in Section 328.Unless the parental rights of the child’s parent or parents have been terminated, they shall be notified that the legal guardianship has been revoked or terminated and shall be entitled to participate in the new permanency planning hearing.  The court shall try to place the child in another permanent placement.  At the hearing, the parents may be considered as custodians but the child shall not be returned to the parent or parents unless they prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that reunification is the best alternative for the child.  The court may, if it is in the best interests of the child, order that reunification services again be provided to the parent or parents.(c) If, following the establishment of a legal guardianship, the county welfare department becomes aware of changed circumstances that indicate adoption may be an appropriate plan for the child, the department shall so notify the court.  The court may vacate its previous order dismissing dependency jurisdiction over the child and order that a hearing be held pursuant to Section 366.26 to determine whether adoption or continued legal guardianship is the most appropriate plan for the child.  The hearing shall be held no later than 120 days from the date of the order.  Whenever the court orders that a hearing shall be held pursuant to Section 366.26, the court shall direct the agency supervising the child and the licensed county adoption agency, or the State Department of Social Services when it is acting as an adoption agency in counties that are not served by a county adoption agency, to prepare an assessment under subdivision (b) of Section 366.22.(d) If the child is in a placement other than the home of a legal guardian and jurisdiction has not been dismissed, the status of the child shall be reviewed at least every six months.  The review of the status of a child for whom the court has ordered parental rights terminated and who has been ordered placed for adoption shall be conducted by the court.  The review of the status of a child for whom the court has not ordered parental rights terminated and who has not been ordered placed for adoption may be conducted by the court or an appropriate local agency.  The court shall conduct the review under the following circumstances:(1) Upon the request of the child’s parents or legal guardians.(2) Upon the request of the child.(3) It has been 12 months since a hearing held pursuant to Section 366.26 or an order that the  child remain in long-term foster care pursuant to Section 366.21, 366.22, 366.26, or subdivision (g).(4) It has been 12 months since a review was conducted by the court.The court shall determine whether or not reasonable efforts to make and finalize a permanent placement for the child have been made.(e) Except as provided in subdivision (f), at the review held every six months pursuant to subdivision (d), the reviewing body shall inquire about the progress being made to provide a permanent home for the child, shall consider the safety of the child, and shall determine all of the following:(1) The continuing necessity for and appropriateness of the placement.(2) The continuing appropriateness and extent of compliance with the permanent plan for the child.(3) The extent of the agency’s compliance with the child welfare services case plan in making reasonable efforts to return the child to a safe home and to complete whatever steps are necessary to finalize the permanent placement of the child.(4) The adequacy of services provided to the child.  The court shall consider the progress in providing the information and documents to the child, as described in Section 391.  The court shall also consider the need for, and progress in providing, the assistance and services described in paragraphs (3) and (4) of subdivision (b) of Section 391.(5) The extent of progress the parents or legal guardians have made toward alleviating or mitigating the causes necessitating placement in foster care.(6) The likely date by which the child may be returned to and safely maintained in the home, placed for adoption, legal guardianship, or in another planned permanent living arrangement.(7) For a child who is 16 years of age or older, the services needed to assist the child to make the transition from foster care to independent living.The reviewing body shall determine whether or not reasonable efforts to make and finalize a permanent placement for the child have been made.Each licensed foster family agency shall submit reports for each child in its care, custody, and control to the court concerning the continuing appropriateness and extent of compliance with the child’s permanent plan, the extent of compliance with the case plan, and the type and adequacy of services provided to the child.Unless their parental rights have been permanently terminated, the parent or parents of the child are entitled to receive notice of, and participate in, those hearings.  It shall be presumed that continued care is in the best interests of the child, unless the parent or parents prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that further efforts at reunification are the best alternative for the child.  In those cases, the court may order that further reunification services to return the child to a safe home environment be provided to the parent or parents for a period not to exceed six months.(f) At the review conducted by the court and held at least every six months, regarding a child for whom the court has ordered parental rights terminated and who has been ordered placed for adoption, the county welfare department shall prepare and present to the court a report describing the following:(1) The child’s present placement.(2) The child’s current physical, mental, emotional, and educational status.(3) Whether the child has been placed with a prospective adoptive parent or parents.(4) Whether an adoptive placement agreement has been signed and filed.(5) The progress of the search for an adoptive placement if one has not been identified.(6) Any impediments to the adoption or the adoptive placement.(7) The anticipated date by which the child will be adopted, or placed in an adoptive home.(8) The anticipated date by which an adoptive placement agreement will be signed.(9) Recommendations for court orders that will assist in the placement of the child for adoption or in the finalization of the adoption.The court shall determine whether or not reasonable efforts to make and finalize a permanent placement for the child have been made.The court shall make appropriate orders to protect the stability of the child and to facilitate and expedite the permanent placement and adoption of the child.(g) At the review held pursuant to subdivision (d) for a child in long-term foster care, the court shall consider all permanency planning options for the child including whether the child should be returned to the home of the parent, placed for adoption, or appointed a legal guardian, or whether the child should remain in long-term foster care.  The court shall order that a hearing be held pursuant to Section 366.26 unless it determines by clear and convincing evidence, that there is a compelling reason for determining that a hearing held pursuant to Section 366.26 is not in the best interest of the child because the child is being returned to the home of the parent, the child is not a proper subject for adoption, or no one is willing to accept legal guardianship.  If the licensed  county adoption agency, or the department when it is acting as an adoption agency in counties that are not served by a county adoption agency, has determined it is unlikely that the child will be adopted or one of the conditions described in paragraph (1) of subdivision (c) of Section 366.26 applies, that fact shall constitute a compelling reason for purposes of this subdivision.  Only upon that determination may the court order that the child remain in long-term foster care, without holding a hearing pursuant to Section 366.26.(h) If, as authorized by subdivision (g), the court orders a hearing pursuant to Section 366.26, the court shall direct the agency supervising the child and the licensed county adoption agency, or the State Department of Social Services when it is acting as an adoption agency in counties that are not served by a county adoption agency, to prepare an assessment as provided for in subdivision (i) of Section 366.21 or subdivision (b) of Section 366.22. A hearing held pursuant to Section 366.26 shall be held no later than 120 days from the date of the 12-month review at which it is ordered, and at that hearing the court shall determine whether adoption, legal guardianship, or long-term foster care is the most appropriate plan for the child.SEC. 2.3. Section 366.3 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:366.3. (a) If a juvenile court orders a permanent plan of adoption or legal guardianship pursuant to Section 360 or 366.26, the court shall retain jurisdiction over the child until the child is adopted or the legal guardianship is established.  The status of the child shall be reviewed every six months to ensure that the adoption or legal guardianship is completed as expeditiously as possible.  When the adoption of the child has been granted, the court shall terminate its jurisdiction over the child.  Following establishment of a legal guardianship, the court may continue jurisdiction over the child as a dependent child of the juvenile court following the establishment of a legal guardianship or may terminate its dependency jurisdiction and retain jurisdiction over the child as a ward of the legal guardianship, as authorized by Section 366.4.  If, however, a relative of the child is appointed the legal guardian of the child and the child has been placed with the relative for at least 12 months, the court shall, except where the relative guardian objects, or upon a finding of exceptional circumstances, terminate its dependency jurisdiction and retain jurisdiction over the child as a ward of the guardianship, as authorized by Section 366.4.  Following a termination of parental rights the parent or parents shall not be a party to, or receive notice of, any subsequent proceedings regarding the child.(b) If the court has dismissed dependency jurisdiction following the establishment of a legal guardianship, or no dependency jurisdiction attached because of the granting of a legal guardianship pursuant to Section 360, and the legal guardianship is subsequently revoked or otherwise terminated, the county department of social services or welfare department shall notify the juvenile court of this fact.  The court may vacate its previous order dismissing dependency jurisdiction over the child.Notwithstanding Section 1601 of the Probate Code, the proceedings to terminate a legal guardianship which has been granted pursuant to Section 360 or 366.26 shall be held in the juvenile court, unless the termination is due to the emancipation or adoption of the child.  Prior to the hearing on a petition to terminate legal guardianship pursuant to this paragraph, the court shall order the county department of social services or welfare department to prepare a report, for the court’s consideration, that shall include an evaluation of whether the child could safely remain in the legal guardian’s home, without terminating the legal guardianship, if services were provided to the child or legal guardian.  If applicable, the report shall also identify recommended services to maintain the legal guardianship and set forth a plan for providing those services.  If the petition to terminate legal guardianship is granted, the juvenile court may resume dependency jurisdiction over the child, and may order the county department of social services or welfare department to develop a new permanent plan, which shall be presented to the court within 60 days of the termination.  If no dependency jurisdiction has attached, the social worker shall make any investigation he or she deems necessary to determine whether the child may be within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court, as provided in Section 328.Unless the parental rights of the child’s parent or parents have been terminated, they shall be notified that the legal guardianship has been revoked or terminated and shall be entitled to participate in the new permanency planning hearing.  The court shall try to place the child in another permanent placement.  At the hearing, the parents may be considered as custodians but the child shall not be returned to the parent or parents unless they prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that reunification is the best alternative for the child.  The court may, if it is in the best interests of the child, order that reunification services again be provided to the parent or parents.(c) If, following the establishment of a legal guardianship, the county welfare department becomes aware of changed circumstances that indicate adoption may be an appropriate plan for the child, the department shall so notify the court.  The court may vacate its previous order dismissing dependency jurisdiction over the child and order that a hearing be held pursuant to Section 366.26 to determine whether adoption or continued legal guardianship is the most appropriate plan for the child.  The hearing shall be held no later than 120 days from the date of the order.  Whenever the court orders that a hearing shall be held pursuant to Section 366.26, the court shall direct the agency supervising the child and the licensed county adoption agency, or the State Department of Social Services when it is acting as an adoption agency in counties that are not served by a county adoption agency, to prepare an assessment under subdivision (b) of Section 366.22.(d) If the child is in a placement other than the home of a legal guardian and jurisdiction has not been dismissed, the status of the child shall be reviewed at least every six months.  The review of the status of a child for whom the court has ordered parental rights terminated and who has been ordered placed for adoption shall be conducted by the court.  The review of the status of a child for whom the court has not ordered parental rights terminated and who has not been ordered placed for adoption may be conducted by the court or an appropriate local agency.  The court shall conduct the review under the following circumstances:(1) Upon the request of the child’s parents or legal guardians.(2) Upon the request of the child.(3) It has been 12 months since a hearing held pursuant to Section 366.26 or an order that the child remain in long-term foster care pursuant to Section 366.21, 366.22, 366.26, or subdivision (g).(4) It has been 12 months since a review was conducted by the court.The court shall determine whether or not reasonable efforts to make and finalize a permanent placement for the child have been made.(e) Except as provided in subdivision (f), at the review held every six months pursuant to subdivision (d), the reviewing body shall inquire about the progress being made to provide a permanent home for the child, shall consider the safety of the child, and shall determine all of the following:(1) The continuing necessity for and appropriateness of the placement.(2) The continuing appropriateness and extent of compliance with the permanent plan for the child.(3) The extent of the agency’s compliance with the child welfare services case plan in making reasonable efforts to return the child to a safe home and to complete whatever steps are necessary to finalize the permanent placement of the child.(4) The adequacy of services provided to the child.  The court shall consider the progress in providing the information and documents to the child, as described in Section 391.  The court shall also consider the need for, and progress in providing, the assistance and services described in paragraphs (3) and (4) of subdivision (b) of Section 391.(5) The extent of progress the parents or legal guardians have made toward alleviating or mitigating the causes necessitating placement in foster care.(6) The likely date by which the child may be returned to and safely maintained in the home, placed for adoption, legal guardianship, or in another planned permanent living arrangement.(7) Whether the child has any siblings under the court’s jurisdiction, and, if any siblings exist, all of the following:(A) The nature of the relationship between the child and his or her siblings.(B) The appropriateness of developing or maintaining the sibling relationships pursuant to Section 16002.(C) If the siblings are not placed together in the same home, why the siblings are not placed together and what efforts are being made to place the siblings together, or why those efforts are not appropriate.(D) If the siblings are not placed together, the frequency and nature of the visits between siblings.(E) The impact of the sibling relationships on the child’s placement and planning for legal permanence.The factors the court may consider as indicators of the nature of the child’s sibling relationships include, but are not limited to, whether the siblings were raised together in the same home, whether the siblings have shared significant common experiences or have existing close and strong bonds, whether either sibling expresses a desire to visit or live with his or her sibling, as applicable, and whether ongoing contact is in the child’s best emotional interests.(8) For a child who is 16 years of age or older, the services needed to assist the child to make the transition from foster care to independent living.The reviewing body shall determine whether or not reasonable efforts to make and finalize a permanent placement for the child have been made.Each licensed foster family agency shall submit reports for each child in its care, custody, and control to the court concerning the continuing appropriateness and extent of compliance with the child’s permanent plan, the extent of compliance with the case plan, and the type and adequacy of services provided to the child.Unless their parental rights have been permanently terminated, the parent or parents of the child are entitled to receive notice of, and participate in, those hearings.  It shall be presumed that continued care is in the best interests of the child, unless the parent or parents prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that further efforts at reunification are the best alternative for the child.  In those cases, the court may order that further reunification services to return the child to a safe home environment be provided to the parent or parents for a period not to exceed six months.(f) At the review conducted by the court and held at least every six months, regarding a child for whom the court has ordered parental rights terminated and who has been ordered placed for adoption, the county welfare department shall prepare and present to the court a report describing the following:(1) The child’s present placement.(2) The child’s current physical, mental, emotional, and educational status.(3) Whether the child has been placed with a prospective adoptive parent or parents.(4) Whether an adoptive placement agreement has been signed and filed.(5) Whether the final adoption order should include provisions for postadoptive sibling contact pursuant to Section 366.29.(6) The progress of the search for an adoptive placement if one has not been identified.(7) Any impediments to the adoption or the adoptive placement.(8) The anticipated date by which the child will be adopted, or placed in an adoptive home.(9) The anticipated date by which an adoptive placement agreement will be signed.(10) Recommendations for court orders that will assist in the placement of the child for adoption or in the finalization of the adoption.The court shall determine whether or not reasonable efforts to make and finalize a permanent placement for the child have been made.The court shall make appropriate orders to protect the stability of the child and to facilitate and expedite the permanent placement and adoption of the child.(g) At the review held pursuant to subdivision (d) for a child in long-term foster care, the court shall consider all permanency planning options for the child including whether the child should be returned to the home of the parent, placed for adoption, or appointed a legal guardian, or whether the child should remain in long-term foster care.  The court shall order that a hearing be held pursuant to Section 366.26 unless it determines by clear and convincing evidence, that there is a compelling reason for determining that a hearing held pursuant to Section 366.26 is not in the best interest of the child because the child is being returned to the home of the parent, the child is not a proper subject for adoption, or no one is willing to accept legal guardianship.  If the licensed county adoption agency, or the department when it is acting as an adoption agency in counties that are not served by a county adoption agency, has determined it is unlikely that the child will be adopted or one of the conditions described in paragraph (1) of subdivision (c) of Section 366.26 applies, that fact shall constitute a compelling reason for purposes of this subdivision.  Only upon that determination may the court order that the child remain in long-term foster care, without holding a hearing pursuant to Section 366.26.(h) If, as authorized by subdivision (g), the court orders a hearing pursuant to Section 366.26, the court shall direct the agency supervising the child and the licensed county adoption agency, or the State Department of Social Services when it is acting as an adoption agency in counties that are not served by a county adoption agency, to prepare an assessment as provided for in subdivision (i) of Section 366.21 or subdivision (b) of Section 366.22. A hearing held pursuant to Section 366.26 shall be held no later than 120 days from the date of the 12-month review at which it is ordered, and at that hearing the court shall determine whether adoption, legal guardianship, or long-term foster care is the most appropriate plan for the child.SEC. 3. Section 391 is added to the Welfare and Institutions Code, to read:391. At any hearing to terminate jurisdiction over a dependent child who has reached the age of majority the county welfare department shall do both of the following:(a) Ensure that the child is present in court, unless the child does not wish to appear in court, or document efforts by the county welfare department to locate the child when the child is not available.(b) Submit a report verifying that the following information, documents, and services have been provided to the child:(1) Written information concerning the child’s dependency case, including his or her family history and placement history, the whereabouts of any siblings under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court, unless the court determines that sibling contact would jeopardize the safety or welfare of the sibling, directions on how to access the documents the child is entitled to inspect under Section 827, and the date on which the jurisdiction of the juvenile court would be terminated.(2) The following documents, where applicable:  social security card, certified birth certificate, identification card, as described in Section 13000 of the Vehicle Code, death certificate of parent or parents, and proof of citizenship or residence.(3) Assistance in completing an application for Medi-Cal or assistance in obtaining other health insurance; referral to transitional housing, if available, or assistance in securing other housing; and assistance in obtaining employment or other financial support.(4) Assistance in applying for admission to college or to a vocational training program or other educational institution and in obtaining financial aid, where appropriate.(c) The court may continue jurisdiction if it finds that the county welfare department has not met the requirements of subdivision (b) and that termination of jurisdiction would be harmful to the best interests of the child.  If the court determines that continued jurisdiction is warranted pursuant to this section, the continuation shall only be ordered for that period of time necessary for the county welfare department to meet the requirements of subdivision (b).  This section shall not be construed to limit the discretion of the juvenile court to continue jurisdiction for other reasons.  The court may terminate jurisdiction if the county welfare department has offered the required services, and the child either has refused the services or, after reasonable efforts by the county welfare department, cannot be located.(d) The Judicial Council shall develop and implement standards, and develop and adopt appropriate forms, necessary to implement this section.SEC. 4. Section 727 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:727. (a) When a minor is adjudged a ward of the court on the ground that he or she is a person described by Section 601 or 602 the court may make any and all reasonable orders for the care, supervision, custody, conduct, maintenance, and support of the minor, including medical treatment, subject to further order of the court.  To facilitate coordination and cooperation among government agencies, the court may, after giving notice and an opportunity to be heard, join in the juvenile court proceedings any agency that the court determines has failed to meet a legal obligation to provide services to the minor.  However, no governmental agency shall be joined as a party in a juvenile court proceeding in which a minor has been ordered committed to the Department of the Youth Authority.  In any proceeding in which an agency is joined, the court shall not impose duties upon the agency beyond those mandated by law.  Nothing in this section shall prohibit agencies which have received notice of the hearing on joinder from meeting prior to the hearing to coordinate services for the minor.The court has no authority to order services unless it has been determined through the administrative process of an agency that has been joined as a party, that the minor is eligible for those services.  With respect to mental health assessment, treatment, and case management services pursuant to Chapter 26.5 (commencing with Section 7570) of Division 7 of Title 1 of the Government Code, the court’s determination shall be limited to whether the agency has complied with that chapter.In the discretion of the court, a ward may be ordered to be on probation without supervision of the probation officer.  The court, in so ordering, may impose on the ward any and all reasonable conditions of behavior as may be appropriate under this disposition.  A minor who has been adjudged a ward of the court on the basis of the commission of any of the offenses described in subdivision (b), paragraph (2) of subdivision (d), or subdivision (e) of Section 707, Section 459 of the Penal Code, or subdivision (a) of Section 11350 of the Health and Safety Code, shall not be eligible for probation without supervision of the probation officer.  A minor who has been adjudged a ward of the court on the basis of the commission of any offense involving the sale or possession for sale of a controlled substance, except misdemeanor offenses involving marijuana, as specified in Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 11053) of Division 10 of the Health and Safety Code, or of an offense in violation of Section 12220 of the Penal Code, shall be eligible for probation without supervision of the probation officer only when the court determines that the interests of justice would best be served and states reasons on the record for that determination.In all other cases, the court shall order the care, custody, and control of the minor to be under the supervision of the probation officer who may place the minor in any of the following:(1) The home of a relative.  When a decision has been made to place the minor in the home of a relative, the court may authorize the relative to give legal consent for the minor’s medical, surgical, and dental care and education as if the relative caretaker were the custodial parent of the minor.(2) A suitable licensed community care facility.(3) With a foster family agency to be placed in a suitable licensed foster family home or certified family home which has been certified by the agency as meeting licensing standards.(b) Where the court has ordered a specific minor placed under the supervision of the probation officer and the probation officer has found that the needs of the child cannot be met in any available licensed or exempt facility, including emergency shelter, the minor may be placed in a suitable family home that has filed a license application with the State Department of Social Services, provided that all the following certification conditions are met:(1) A preplacement home visit is made by the probation officer to determine the suitability of the family home.(2) The probation officer verifies to the licensing agency in writing that the home lacks any deficiencies which would threaten the physical health, mental health, safety, or welfare of the minor.(3) The probation officer notifies the licensing agency of the proposed placement and determines that the foster family home applicant has filed specific license application documents prior to and after the placement of the minor.  If the license is subsequently denied, the minor shall be removed from the home immediately.  The denial of the license constitutes a withdrawal of the certification.When a minor has been adjudged a ward of the court on the ground that he or she is a person described in Section 601 or 602 and the court finds that notice has been given in accordance with Section 661, and when the court orders that a parent or guardian shall retain custody of that minor either subject to or without the supervision of the probation officer, the parent or guardian may be required to participate with that minor in a counseling or education program including, but not limited to, parent education and parenting programs operated by community colleges, school districts, or other appropriate agencies designated by the court.(c) The juvenile court may direct any and all reasonable orders to the parents and guardians of the minor who is the subject of any proceedings under this chapter as the court deems necessary and proper to carry out subdivisions (a) and (b), including orders to appear before a county financial evaluation officer and orders directing the parents or guardians to ensure the minor’s regular school attendance and to make reasonable efforts to obtain appropriate educational services necessary to meet the needs of the minor.When counseling or other treatment services are ordered for the minor, the parent, guardian, or foster parent shall be ordered to participate in those services, unless participation by the parent, guardian, or foster parent is deemed by the court to be inappropriate or potentially detrimental to the child.SEC. 5. (a) Section 1.5 of this bill incorporates amendments to Section 362 of the Welfare and Institutions Code proposed by both this bill and SB 1611.  It shall only become operative if (1) both bills are enacted and become effective on or before January 1, 2001, (2) each bill amends Section 362 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, and (3) this bill is enacted after SB 1611, in which case Section 1 of this bill shall not become operative.(b) Section 2.1 of this bill incorporates amendments to Section 366.3 of the Welfare and Institutions Code proposed by both this bill and AB 1987.
