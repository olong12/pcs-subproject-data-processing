                          Pharmacy.Existing law generally prohibits a person from dispensing a prescription unless he or she is a pharmacist, in which case a prescription must be given to the pharmacist.Existing law permits a pharmacist to refill a prescription without the prescriber’s authorization if the prescriber is unavailable to authorize the refill and, if in the pharmacist’s professional judgment, failure to refill the prescription may interrupt the patient’s ongoing care and have a significant adverse effect on the patient’s well-being.This bill would provide for the purposes of these provisions that from the period commencing November 1, 1999, and ending February 29, 2000, a prescriber shall be deemed unavailable to authorize a refill if the pharmacist is unable to contact the prescriber with reasonable effort, and the inability to contact the prescriber arises from problems caused by computer failures arising from the inability of computers to properly handle dates after January 1, 2000.This bill would provide that notwithstanding any other provision of law, during the period commencing November 1, 1999, and ending February 29, 2000, (1) a prescriber shall be deemed unavailable to authorize a refill if confronted with problems caused by computer failures arising from the inability of computers to properly handle dates; and (2) a pharmacist may refill a prescription, based upon a request made by the patient who is taking the medication, for up to and including 90 days from the date of the request.The bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.Digest Key
