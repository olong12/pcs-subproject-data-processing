              LempertFebruary 23, 1999An act to amend Section 12017 of the Fish and Game Code, and to amend Sections 8670.3, 8670.64, 8670.66, 8670.67, and 8670.70 of, and to add Sections 8670.2.5, 8670.4.5, 8670.67.3, and 8670.75 to, the Government Code, relating to oil spills, and making an appropriation therefor.LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 680, Lempert.
                          Oil spill prevention:  nonmarine waters.(1) The existing Lempert-Keene-Seastrand Oil Spill Prevention and Response Act, among other things, governs the prevention of oil spills into marine waters, as defined.This bill would define the term “waters of the state” for purposes of the act and, for purposes of spills or discharges of oil into nonmarine waters of the state, the bill would limit the definition of the term “person” under the act.  The bill would specify that the act does not apply to a discharge or spill of oil to groundwater or dry land, unless a specified amount of the oil enters the surface water.(2) Under the act, it is a crime to, among other things, knowingly engage in or cause the spill or discharge of at least one barrel (42 gallons) of oil into marine waters, and the intentional or negligent spill or discharge of that quantity of oil into marine waters is also subject to specified civil penalties, as prescribed.  Existing law imposes civil and administrative penalties upon persons who fail to comply with specified plans, orders, or notification requirements with regard to discharges or spills.Under existing law, the Fish and Wildlife Pollution Account in the Fish and Game Preservation Fund is continuously appropriated to the Department of Fish and Game for specified restoration purposes relating to pollution abatement, and resource restoration and preservation.This bill would make such a spill or discharge of oil into nonmarine waters of the state on or after January 1, 2001, or noncompliance with those plans, orders, or notification requirements after that date, subject to specified criminal, civil, and administrative penalties.  The bill would therefore impose a state-mandated local program by creating a new crime.The bill would require specified factors to be considered in determining the amount of criminal, civil, or administrative penalties to be imposed for such a spill or discharge.  The bill would require all penalties collected that are derived from those spills or discharges to be deposited in the Fish and Wildlife Pollution Account in the Fish and Game Preservation Fund.  The bill would make an appropriation by providing for the deposit of those penalties into a continuously appropriated account.  The bill would make conforming changes and prescribe related matters.
   (3) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.Digest Key
      Appropriation:
      YES  Bill TextThe people of the State of California do enact as follows:SECTION 1. It is the intent of the Legislature that this act does not apply to spills or discharges of oil or petroleum products by agricultural operations into waters of the state, other than marine waters.SEC. 1.5. Section 12017 of the Fish and Game Code is amended to read:12017. (a) Notwithstanding Section 13001, any recovery or settlement of money received pursuant to the following sections shall be deposited in the Fish and Wildlife Pollution Account:(1) Section 2014.(2) Article 1 (commencing with Section 5650) of Chapter 2 of Part 1 of Division 6.(3) Section 12015 or 12016.(4) Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 151) of Division 1.5 of the Harbors and Navigation Code.(5) Section 13442 of the Water Code.(6) Proceeds or recoveries from pollution and abatement actions.  (7) Section 8670.75 of the Government Code.(b) Moneys in the account are continuously appropriated to the department, except as provided in Section 13230.(c) Funds in the account shall be expended for the following purposes:(1) Abatement, cleanup, and removal of pollutants from the environment.(2) Response coordination, planning, and program management.(3) Resource injury determination.(4) Resource damage assessment.(5) Economic valuation of resources.(6) Restoration or rehabilitation at sites damaged by pollution.(d) Notwithstanding subdivision (c), funds in the account in excess of one million dollars ($1,000,000) as of July 1 of each year may also be expended for the preservation of California plants, wildlife, and fisheries.(e) Funds in the account may be expended for cleanup and abatement if a reasonable effort has been made to have the responsible party pay cleanup and abatement costs and funds are not available for disbursement from the emergency reserve account of the Hazardous Waste Control Account in the General Fund pursuant to Section 25354 of the Health and Safety Code.(f) The department may use funds in the account to pay the costs of consultant contracts for resource injury determination or damage assessment during hazardous material or oil spill emergencies.  These contracts are not subject to Part 2 (commencing with Section 10100) of Division 2 of the Public Contract Code.SEC. 2. Section 8670.2.5 is added to the Government Code, to read:8670.2.5. The Legislature further finds and declares as follows:(a) Each year, billions of gallons of crude oil and petroleum products are stored or transported by pipeline or other means across and adjacent to the waters of the state.(b) Recent discharges in California and other parts of the nation have shown that the discharge of oil can be a significant threat to the environment.(c) Although spill prevention programs may reduce the risk of a significant discharge of petroleum into the nonmarine waters of the state, fines and penalties associated with those spills or discharges are insufficient when compared to similar spills or discharges into the marine waters of the state.(d) Penalties resulting from spills or discharges into the nonmarine waters of the state occurring from pipelines under the jurisdiction of the Office of the State Fire Marshal or the United States Department of Transportation; from oil production wells, whether active, inactive, or abandoned, and the gathering lines, pipelines, and flow lines associated therewith, under the jurisdiction of the Department of Conservation; from refineries; and from spills or discharges resulting from the transport of oil or petroleum products by rail or vessel should be comparable to those imposed for the spill or discharge of oil or petroleum products into the marine waters of the state.SEC. 3. Section 8670.3 of the Government Code is amended to read:8670.3. Unless the context requires otherwise, the following definitions shall govern the construction of this chapter:(a) “Administrator” means the administrator for oil spill response appointed by the Governor pursuant to Section 8670.4.(b) “Barge” means any vessel that carries oil in commercial quantities as cargo but is not equipped with a means of self-propulsion.(c) (1) “Best achievable protection” means that the highest level of protection that can be achieved through both the use of the best achievable technology and those manpower levels, training procedures, and operational methods that provide the greatest degree of protection achievable.

Instead, it is the intent of the Legislature that the administrator give reasonable consideration to the protection provided by the measures, the technological achievability of the measures, and the cost of the measures when establishing the requirements to provide the best achievable protection for coastal and marine resources.(d) “Best achievable technology” means that technology that provides the greatest degree of protection, taking into consideration (1) processes that are being developed, or could feasibly be developed anywhere in the world, given overall reasonable expenditures on research and development, and (2) processes that are currently in use anywhere in the world.
