The bill would create the Youth  Recreation Prevention and Enrichment Opportunity Fund in the State Treasury, and would require that all moneys deposited in the fund be made available for expenditure by the Department of Parks and Recreation Office of Criminal Justice Planning, upon appropriation by the Legislature, to fund grants for the support of programs designed to enhance access by persons 18 years of age or younger to recreation and enrichment programs and facilities, as defined, sponsored by specified entities and organizations.The bill would require the department office to establish a competitive grant program, as specified, and would prescribe the purposes for which grants may be awarded under the act.  The bill would require the department office to establish criteria for the funding of those grants.  The bill would specify that funding for the act would be derived from federal moneys made available to the state as a result of a settlement agreement arising out of litigation with the tobacco industry in federal court.  The bill would also authorize the  department office to seek additional funding from other public and private sources.Digest Key

      NO  Bill TextThe people of the State of California do enact as follows:SECTION 1. The Legislature hereby finds and declares all of the following:(a)Local park, recreation, and community service agencies and nonprofit providers of youth oriented services have played an integral part in the physical and emotional development of countless youth, providing programs and youth services to constructively occupy discretionary time.(b)Studies prepared by the Little Hoover Commission and other notable public and private organizations maintain that early intervention in the lives of youth is the most cost-effective manner to prevent delinquency.(a) California has been active in the development and implementation of programs designed to prevent youth crime and delinquency. (b) The Office of Criminal Justice Planning has demonstrated a positive history of working with local agencies and nonprofit youth service providers to promote programs and activities leading to positive social outcomes.(c) Studies have indicated that 60 percent of an adolescent’s waking hours are committed to essentials such as homework, chores, or paid employment, leaving the other 40 percent of an adolescent’s time fully unsupervised and discretionary in nature.(d) Park, recreation, community service, and other nonprofit youth oriented professionals and the facilities they administer offer a valuable resource for youth in the form of physical and social infrastructure.(e) Parents and legal guardians remain the largest influence on today’s youth; however, park, recreation, and community service agencies and other nonprofit youth service providers are a visible “support apparatus” to help reinforce positive social values.(f) Interaction with park and recreation professional staff and other nonprofit youth service professionals creates a social framework in which youth may discover positive mentoring and “role modeling” experiences.(g) As part of California’s urban renewal, greater emphasis needs to be placed on providing funding opportunities and investing in community youth sports and cultural centers to provide children with safe venues for recreational and enrichment purposes to prevent at-risk behavior, including gang involvement, delinquency, tobacco and drug abuse, and other antisocial outcomes.(h) Although the needs for park, recreation, and youth enrichment services are great in California’s urban areas, many of the rural and suburban areas of the state are underserved in terms of youth park, recreation, and enrichment programs and facilities and have legitimate needs for those services as well.(i) In addition to reinforcing constructive behaviorial patterns, the development of positive social outlet such as sports and athletics assists in the physical well being and the cardiovascular development of the state’s youth.(j) Antismoking educational programs implemented statewide have resulted in a reduction of cigarette consumption among teens.  However, there also needs to be a recognition of the nexus between sports, athletics and youth enrichment programs and the relative importance of these programs in reducing teen smoking.SEC. 2. Section 5011.6 is added to the Public Resources Code, to read:5011.6. (a) This section shall be known, and may be cited, as the Youth Recreation Prevention and Enrichment Opportunity Act.  The act is established for the purpose of funding grants for youth recreation and enrichment programs and facilities, as defined in subdivision (l).(b) The Youth Recreation Prevention and Enrichment Opportunity Fund is hereby created in the State Treasury.  All moneys deposited into the fund shall be available for expenditure by the department office, upon appropriation by the Legislature, to fund grants for the support of programs designed to enhance access by persons 18 years of age or younger to recreation and enrichment programs sponsored by city and county park and recreation agencies, park and recreation districts, and nonprofit youth service organizations, including law enforcement youth oriented service providers.(c) The department office shall establish a competitive grant program for the purpose of awarding grants to public and nonprofit entities that implement youth recreation and enrichment programs and facilities.  The recipients of a grant awarded pursuant to this section shall collaborate, whenever possible, with other community youth service organizations and other entities that provide recreational and enrichment opportunities for minors.(d) No grant applicant may receive a grant awarded pursuant to this section unless the applicant provides matching funds in an amount equal to not less than 25 percent of the total amount of the grant.  However, the  department office may waive the matching fund requirement if the grant applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the department office that an unusual fiscal circumstance or hardship exists that prevents the applicant from providing matching funds.  The matching funds required to be provided by a grant applicant may be provided in the form of an in-kind contribution.(e) Grants may be awarded pursuant to this section for any of the following purposes:(1) The development, construction, or rehabilitation of youth recreation and enrichment facilities, including community cultural centers.(2) To assist in providing startup funding or underwriting the costs, including transportation costs for participation in youth recreation and enrichment programs by children from low- or middle-income households in those areas of the state where inadequate programs exist, as determined by the  department office.(3) To establish programs to increase participation in youth recreation and enrichment programs serving youth that take place in new or existing park and recreational facilities or joint use facilities with public schools.(f) The department office shall establish criteria for funding grants pursuant to this section.(g) Prior to determining the criteria to be utilized for funding grants pursuant to subdivision (f), the department office shall hold one public hearing in northern California and one public hearing in southern California.(h) In determining the criteria for funding grants pursuant to this section, the department office shall give priority to all of the following:(1) Applicant entities that represent underserved areas wherein, on a population basis, there are proportionately fewer youth recreation and enrichment programs and facilities than the statewide average, as determined by the department office.(2) Programs and facilities that are most likely to alleviate gang involvement, juvenile delinquency, and criminal activity among youth.(3) Joint applications by more than one public and nonprofit youth service provider that has a demonstrated history of working with at-risk youth and gang members.(i) Funding for this section shall be provided from federal moneys made available to the state as a result of a settlement agreement arising out of litigation with the tobacco industry in federal court in which the state is a party.  The department office may also seek additional funding for the grant program from other public and private sources, including, but not limited to, the proceeds of future general obligation bonds issued for the support of park improvements, and any other appropriate funding made available by the federal government.(j) The department office may retain up to 3.5 percent of any funds received for the purposes of this section to cover the department’s office’s costs of administering the grant program.(k) To the extent possible, any funds allocated for grants pursuant to this section shall be proportionally distributed between eligible programs and eligible facilities.  In an effort to reduce tobacco consumption, any grant applicant that is awarded funding pursuant to this section shall offer health and tobacco education and training.(l) For the purposes of this section, “youth recreation prevention and enrichment programs and facilities” means projects designed to promote and enhance youth services, opportunities, and facilities in a community, including, but not limited to, programs and facilities that support sports and athletic activities, cultural programs, visual and performing arts, enrichment programs, youth camping, and any other youth recreational or enrichment opportunities, as determined by the community, that promote a positive outlet to reinforce constructive physical and social skills.(m)For purposes of this section, “department” means the Department of Parks and Recreation.(n)The department(m) The office shall seek an equitable balance among urban, suburban, and rural communities in making grants pursuant to this section.(n) For purposes of this section, “office” means the Office of Criminal Justice Planning.SEC. 3. It is the intent of the Legislature that at least 1 percent of the funds received by the state as a result of the Master Settlement Agreement entered into by the state and tobacco products manufacturers on November 23, 1998, be utilized to fund grants for the delivery of youth recreation and enrichment programs in the state pursuant to Section 5011.6 of the Public Resources Code.
