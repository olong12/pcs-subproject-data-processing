An act to add Article 8.1 (commencing with Section 54753) to Chapter 9 of Part 29 of the Education Code, relating to pupil testing.LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 666, as amended, Romero.
                          Student financial assistance College admissions testing opportunity program.Existing law authorizes the establishment of college admissions test preparation pilot projects for school districts maintaining high schools.This bill would require the Superintendent of Public Instruction to establish a statewide college admissions test-taking program for the purpose of enabling pupils from public high schools that are underrepresented in 4-year postsecondary educational institutions to take advantage of the development and implementation of effective innovative methods and test preparation activities by test sponsors designed to increase the number of pupils taking college admissions tests and to improve their test-taking skills, improving rates of completion of college preparatory courses, and improving college attendance rates.The bill would state the intent of the Legislature that the program be funded in the annual Budget Act and would provide that funding for the program would not apply toward the requirement in Section 8 of Article XVI of the California Constitution that the state provide a minimum level of funding for school districts and community college districts.The bill would provide that its provisions would become operative on July 1, 2001.Under existing law, there is a state educational opportunity grant program known as the Cal Grant Program, with a long-term program policy relative to providing educational opportunity by ensuring both student access to and selection of an institution of higher education for students with financial need.This bill would establish the California Youth Service Scholarship Program, to be administered by the California Commission on Improving Life Through Service, or if the commission ceases to exist, by the State Department of Education, which is to be a pilot program in effect for the fiscal years 2000–01 to 2004–05, inclusive.  Under the program, a pupil would earn a $500 scholarship while the pupil is enrolled in a California public school that is involved in a consortium that has been selected for participation in the program, in any of grades 9 to 12, inclusive, by completing 100 hours of volunteer community service, as defined.  A pupil would redeem the scholarship at a private or public postsecondary or vocational institution after the pupil graduates from high school or receives a high school equivalency certificate.  The maximum amount of a scholarship a pupil could earn would be $2,000 if a pupil is selected by the consortia and has performed the required amount of community service during each of grades 9 to 12, inclusive. The bill would authorize any public or private not-for-profit organization, including schools, located in California to participate as a service site if the service to be provided by pupils seeking to earn scholarships meets the definition of community service developed by the California Commission on Improving Life Through Service.  The bill would require the consortia to give priority to service sites that meet the needs of low-income youth or focus on reducing juvenile delinquency, or both.  The bill would require the California Commission on Improving Life Through Service to ensure that consortia and participating service sites comply with all applicable state and federal child welfare laws.The bill would also require that administrative costs not exceed actual costs up to a maximum of 10% in the 2000–01 fiscal year and 6% thereafter.   The bill would require the California Commission on Improving Life Through Service to reimburse participating school districts or county offices of education within a consortia for administrative costs incurred in administrating the program, in an amount that does not exceed 5% of the amount of each scholarship administered by that school district or county office of education.  The bill would require the California Research Bureau, by July 1, 2004, to submit to the Legislature a study of the efficacy of the program.  The bill would provide that the program would be implemented only to the extent that funds for that purpose are appropriated in the annual Budget Act.  The program established by the bill would be repealed on January 1, 2006.Digest Key

SECTION 1.It is the intent of the Legislature toArticle 8.1 (commencing with Section 54753) is added to Chapter 9 of Part 29 of the Education Code, to read:
                Article
               8.1. College Admissions Testing Opportunity Program54753. (a) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that students from several social groups and disadvantaged economic backgrounds remain seriously underrepresented in admissions to the California State University and the University of California, and the independent colleges and universities of the State of California, and that efforts to promote the increased eligibility of these students to these institutions must begin at the earliest opportunity for intervention during the educational process.  The Legislature also finds and declares that research conducted by the California Postsecondary Education Commission has identified, among other barriers, that the lack of test-taking opportunities in school districts maintaining high schools with high populations of students from these social groups and disadvantaged economic backgrounds and the failure of these students to participate in meaningful numbers during test-taking opportunities are contributors to the low admissions levels.  The Legislature further finds and declares that the Superintendent of Public Instruction and the local boards of education should, as recommended by the Joint Committee for Review of the Master Plan for Higher Education, take all necessary steps to encourage secondary school students to take the core curriculum required by the University of California and the California State University in order that their eligibility for admission to four-year postsecondary educational institutions is maintained.(b) It is the intent of the Legislature by enacting this article to improve college attendance rates, and to enable these students to take advantage of the development and implementation of effective innovative testing methods by test sponsors designed to increase the number of students taking these college admissions tests.  It is not the intent of the Legislature that this program be designed exclusively for the purpose of preparing students to take a particular test.54754. The Superintendent of Public Instruction shall establish a statewide college test-taking program for eligible regular public high schools in accordance with the requirements of this article.  The goals of the program shall include all of the following: (a) The promotion of testing programs in order that the numbers of pupils, especially those pupils who have pursued a college preparatory course of study or who are otherwise reasonably prepared for college-level work, attending the regular public high schools identified pursuant to Section 54754.3 who take college admissions tests will increase, and in order that pupils potentially eligible for matriculation to four-year postsecondary educational institutions are not excluded because they fail to take the tests.(b) Use of aggregate data from college admissions test results to determine changes in course content, or course taking patterns that may be needed to increase the number of pupils from underrepresented high schools who gain admittance to four-year postsecondary educational institutions so that their numbers approach the average admissions rate for all high school pupils.(c) Encouragement of schools and school districts to make available to the California Postsecondary Education Commission the results of site specific school testing information in order to further the compilation of test-taking data.(d) An increase in information from, and services provided by, testing companies and postsecondary institutions to high schools with high percentages of pupils who do not enter four-year postsecondary educational institutions, and to the pupils who attend those schools and their parents or guardians.(e) Strong encouragement to each college admissions test company to provide for pupil testing at each participating high school during the regular schoolday on dates selected by the Superintendent of Public Instruction.(f) Use of information gained from the initial college admissions test preparation pilot projects to assist participating high schools to engage in those activities which are most cost effective in increasing the number of pupils from underrepresented high schools who take, and demonstrate competence on, college admissions tests.(g) An increase in high school staff capabilities to counsel and assist pupils in college preparatory and college admissions test preparation activities through eligible staff participation in any applicable existing statewide staff development programs.54754.3. For purposes of this article, the Superintendent of Public Instruction shall, each year, do all of the following:(a) Make a projection regarding the number of schools that can be funded based on the amount of funding appropriated for the purposes of this article.(b) Notify school districts of the high schools within their jurisdictions that would be deemed low-performing subject to the provisions set forth in Section 52052.(c) Select a single date, after consulting with college admissions testing companies and school administrators, for inschool administration of college admissions tests in the high schools that receive funding under this article.54754.5. A school district that elects to participate in the program established by this article shall apply to the Superintendent of Public Instruction on behalf of the high schools in the district that have been identified as potentially eligible for funding pursuant to subdivisions (a) and (b) of Section 54754.3.54754.7. The school district shall provide assurances to the Superintendent of Public Instruction that any high school within the district for which funding is requested shall comply with all of the following conditions:(a) Funds allocated pursuant to this article shall be expended at the selected high schools only to carry out the purposes of this article.(b) Information on the structure and content of each college admissions test, as provided by the test companies, shall be provided to all pupils at the high school and test preparation guidance and instruction shall be provided to each participating pupil.(c) Opportunity shall be given to each college admissions testing company to administer its test at the high school during a regular schoolday on the date selected by the Superintendent of Public Instruction pursuant to subdivision (c) of Section 54754.3.(d) Per pupil costs of onsite testing shall not exceed the per pupil costs commonly paid by pupils for college admissions tests.(e) The cost of testing for all pupils participating in the program shall be paid from funds allocated to the high school under this article, or from other available funds.(f) College admissions testing companies shall be requested to provide information packets, in-service training for teachers, parent information, and student study packets.(g) A goal of increasing the number of underrepresented pupils at participating high schools who take the preliminary and actual college admission tests so that the number of pupils from participating high schools who take the tests equal the average for all high schools in the state within three years shall be established.(h) Information needed by the Superintendent of Public Instruction in order to evaluate the progress of the program and to determine and increase its effectiveness shall be provided as requested.(i) Information on test results shall be reviewed annually and used, where appropriate, to change course content and course taking patterns so that the number of students qualified for admission to four-year postsecondary educational institutions shall be increased.(j) Substantial in-kind services and available school district funds shall be provided to supplement funding allocations made by the Superintendent of Public Instruction to school districts and participating high schools under this article.54755. It is the intent of the Legislature that the governing board of each school district operating a college admissions test program pursuant to this article shall establish and maintain test preparation activities for the benefit of pupils and parents or guardians.  A plan for test preparation activities shall be adopted at a public meeting of the governing board and shall include, but need not be limited to, all of the following:(a) Activities and materials for pupils designed to enable them to comprehend the requirements of college admissions tests, including a review of nonsecure  test content, a review of test-taking strategies, the computation of raw scores, the interpretation of test scores, and special preparations, as appropriate. (b) Activities and materials designed to encourage 9th, 10th, and 11th grade pupils to participate in college preparatory programs, to take preliminary college admissions tests during regular school hours at the schoolsite, and to assist them to evaluate their performances, improve their test taking strategy, identify areas where academic improvement may be needed prior to taking the college admissions test and enroll in enriched, honors, the International Baccalaureate Program and advanced placement courses that are beneficial to their academic progress.(c) Activities and materials for teachers and counselors designed to facilitate their assistance of pupils to learn from the testing experience, including an evaluation of the test component contents, the review of test strategies, study designs for developing appropriate test preparation activities, and guidelines for the interpretation of group data and test results.(d) Activities and materials for parents designed to assist and encourage their involvement with the test-taking and college decisionmaking experience of their children, including clear and easily understood descriptions of the role, uses, the interpretation of college admissions tests, and information on the details and requirements of the examination process and college and university admissions application procedures.54755.5. Each college admissions testing company that serves pupils attending a high school participating in the program established by this article shall do all of the following:(a) Administer the college admissions test at each high school participating in the program during school hours on dates selected by the Superintendent of Public Instruction pursuant to subdivision (c) of Section 54754.3.The college admissions test shall be administered by the college admissions testing company using the same standards and procedures as are currently used for national test date administrations of the test.(b) Provide testing information to participating high schools, pupils, and parents or guardians in amounts and quality equal to that provided to other schools, pupils, and parents or guardians.(c) Establish testing fees to be charged for pupils at participating high schools that are no higher than fees charged other pupils.54756. The Superintendent of Public Instruction shall submit a report to the Legislature on January 1 of each year regarding the implementation and effectiveness of the college admissions test program established by this article.  The report shall include data on all of the following:(a) Any increased pupil participation in college admissions test taking in schools that receive funding under this article.(b) Any improvements in pupil performance on each of the commonly accepted college admissions tests, including performance on subtests.(c) Any increase in the numbers of pupils from schools participating in the program that enroll in four-year postsecondary educational institutions.(d) The levels of support provided by test sponsors to high schools participating in the program.54756.5. The Superintendent of Public Instruction shall each year allocate the funds appropriated for the support of this article until the appropriation is depleted, to school districts that are participating in the college admissions testing opportunity program.54756.7. (a) It is the intent of the Legislature that the college preparation and college admissions test preparation program established by this article be funded in the annual Budget Act, beginning with the Budget Act for the 2001–02 fiscal year, from new or redirected funds that are appropriated for that purpose.(b) The Legislature finds and declares that funding appropriated for this program does not constitute “moneys to be applied by the state for the support of school districts and community college districts” for purposes of Section 8 of Article XVI of the California Constitution.54756.9. This article shall become operative on July 1, 2001.establish the California Youth Service Scholarship Program to accomplish all of the following goals:(a)Provide California’s youth with opportunities to do all of the following:(1)Give back to their communities through service.(2)Enhance their access to a college education.(3)Develop, in “real life” situations, the skills and understanding critical to their development as students, workers, and community members.(4)Develop a lifelong ethic of service and a richer understanding of citizenship in a democratic society.(b)Deter juvenile delinquency by providing California’s youth with after school and intersession alternatives that promote public service.(c)Form a partnership between schools and community organizations dedicated to building responsibility and broadening higher education opportunities for California’s youth.(d)Mobilize youth, an often neglected resource, in service that meets the critical needs of their communities by, for example, tutoring preschool children in reading, assisting licensed providers care for infants and toddlers, helping with after school recreational programs and nutritional programs for elementary school pupils, helping the frail elderly to live independently, contributing to neighborhood cleanup and housing rehabilitation projects, and assisting their peers to become involved in community service.
