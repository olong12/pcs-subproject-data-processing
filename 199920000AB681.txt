                          Vehicles:  traffic violator schools:  court-authorized programs.(1) Under existing law, a person is entitled to have a complaint relating to the safe operation of a vehicle dismissed with a copy of that dismissal forwarded to the Department of Motor Vehicles when a person attends a licensed traffic violator school, licensed driving school, or other court-approved program of driving instruction.  Existing law requires traffic violator schools to meet specified criteria, including the requirement that the schools have a specified lesson plan approved by the department.This bill would require programs of driving instruction, rather than court-approved programs of driving instruction, to also be licensed by the department.  The bill would prohibit any person from operating a program of driving instruction without a current valid license issued by the department.  This bill would allow certain home study programs operating prior to January 1, 2000, to continue until approved or disapproved by the department.This bill would also require the department to develop, or contract for the development of, a standardized traffic violator school curriculum, as specified and would make special provision for home study programs.  The bill would require this curriculum, except as specified, to be used uniformly by traffic violator schools and other programs of driving instruction by July 1, 2001.The bill would require each person participating in a school or program to demonstrate his or her knowledge of course materials through the completion and passage of an exit test, as specified.This bill would also establish a Traffic School Instructor Training Committee and would set forth its duties and membership composition.(2) Existing law requires every person to qualify as a traffic violator school instructor to meet specified requirements including requiring that person to be 18 years of age or older.This bill would increase the age requirement from 18 years of age or older to 21 years of age or older and would add to those qualification requirements the requirement that the person successfully complete an instructional training program developed by the department.(3) Existing law requires the department to require for the renewal of a traffic violator school instructor license, among other things, satisfactory completion of an examination or the submission of evidence of continuing professional education.This bill would include completion of an instructional training program described in (2) as evidence of continuing professional education and would require, if not previously completed, the successful completion of the program described in (2).(4) Under existing law, in order to qualify as a traffic violator school operator and be issued a license by the department, a person is required, among other things, to be 18 years of age and to have worked for an established California traffic violator school as an instructor for a specified period.This bill would increase the age requirement from 18 years of age or older to 21 years of age or older and would also allow a person to operated as an instructor at an established, licensed California driving school or at an established commercial driving training and education program operated by a bona fide labor organization to qualify as a traffic violator school operator and be issued a license.(5) Under existing law, a court is authorized to take certain action regarding a traffic violator school’s name and the removal of the name from the referral list of traffic violator schools.  Existing law requires the approval of the court in each judicial district wherein a proposed traffic school owner or traffic classes are to be conducted prior to the school being included on the referral list.This bill would impose those duties on the department rather than the courts and would delete the  provisions currently requiring court approval of traffic violator schools and classes.  The bill would also include department-approved home study programs on the referral list.(6) Existing law authorizes the department to monitor any school for traffic violators.This bill would require the department to monitor or audit traffic violator schools and would include home study programs within its scope.  The bill would require the department to provide staffing for these purposes, as specified.(6)(7) Existing law currently does not specifically authorize the use of home study programs of driving instruction as a court-approved program.This bill would specifically authorize a court to allow certain categories of traffic violators to participate in a department-approved home study program of driving instruction and, upon completion, to be issued a certificate of completion.(7)(8) Existing law authorizes a court to utilize the services of a nonprofit agency for traffic violator school administration and monitoring services and charge traffic violators a fee to defray the costs incurred by the agency for providing those services.  The fee is limited to the actual cost incurred by the agency or $5, whichever is less.This bill would delete the specified limitation on the fee amount.(8)(9) Existing law requires the department to charge a fee, based upon a determination made by the department, as specified, which is not to exceed $3 for each completion certificate issued by a traffic violator school or court-authorized program to a person completing instruction in the school or program.  Existing law prohibits a traffic violator school from charging a fee in excess of the fee charged by the department for furnishing a certificate of completion.This bill would require the department to charge a fee of $3 and would delete the related provisions that require the department to determine the amount of the fee.The bill would also delete the above-described fee restriction imposed on traffic violator schools.(9)(10) The bill would require the department to conduct certain evaluations and studies regarding traffic violator schools and report the results of those evaluations and studies to the Legislature on or before July 1, 2003.(10)(11) The bill would make related changes.(11)(12) Because a violation of certain provisions of the bill would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program by creating new crimes.(12)(13) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state.  Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.Digest Key

The department shall require compliance with Section 11202 for renewal of the license of a traffic violator school owner.
