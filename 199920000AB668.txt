              VincentFebruary 23, 1999An act to amend Sections 1410 and 14402 of the Elections Code, relating to elections.LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 668, as introduced, Vincent.
                          Elections.(1) Existing law requires that an election on a county or municipal local referendum be held either at the jurisdiction’s next regular election occurring not less than 88 days from the order of election or at a special election called for that purpose not less than 88 days after the date of the order of election.This bill would instead require that the election be held at the next regular election occurring not less than 90 days from the order of election or, if a special election, to be held not less than 90 days after the date of the order of election.(2) Existing law provides that any one who arrives at the polling place after the time provided for closing the polls shall not be entitled to vote, even though the polls are open when the voter arrives.This bill would instead make this provision apply to any one who arrives 15 or more minutes after the time for closing the polls. (3) By extending the time for voting, this bill would thereby impose a state-mandated local program.
   The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement, including the creation of a State Mandates Claims Fund to pay the costs of mandates that do not exceed $1,000,000 statewide and other procedures for claims whose statewide costs exceed $1,000,000.This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.Digest Key
