                          Medi-Cal.Existing law provides for the Medi-Cal program, administered by the State Department of Health Services, under which qualified low-income persons are provided with health care services.This bill would make nonsubstantive technical changes in these provisions.Existing law establishes the Cigarette and Tobacco Products Surtax Fund consisting of certain revenues that may only be appropriated for certain purposes.This bill would appropriate the sum of $14,941,000 from that fund to the department to fund the Breast Cancer Early Detection Program.The bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.Digest Key

      YES  Bill TextThe people of the State of California do enact as follows:SECTION 1. Section 14132.47 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:14132.47. (a) It is the intent of the Legislature to provide local governmental agencies the choice of participating in either or both of the Targeted Case Management (TCM) and Administrative Claiming process programs at their option, subject to the requirements of this section and Section 14132.44.(b) The department may contract with each participating local governmental agency or each local educational consortium to assist with the performance of administrative activities necessary for the proper and efficient administration of the Medi-Cal program, pursuant to Section 1396b(a) of Title 42 of the United States Code, Section 1903a of the federal Social Security Act, and this activity shall be known as the Administrative Claiming process.(c) (1) As a condition for participation in the Administrative Claiming process, each participating local governmental agency or each local educational consortium shall, for the purpose of claiming federal medicaid matching funds, enter into a contract with the department and shall certify to the department the amount of local governmental agency or each local educational consortium general funds or any other funds allowed under federal law and regulation expended on the allowable administrative activities.(2) The department shall deny the claim if it determines that the certification is not adequately supported for purposes of federal financial participation.(d) Each participating local governmental agency or local educational consortium may subcontract with nongovernmental entities to assist with the performance of administrative activities necessary for the proper and efficient administration of the Medi-Cal program under the conditions specified by the department in regulations.(e) Each Administrative Claiming process contract shall include a requirement that each participating local governmental agency or each local educational consortium submit a claiming plan in a manner that shall be prescribed by the department in regulations, developed in consultation with local governmental agencies.(f) The department shall require that each participating local governmental agency or each local educational consortium certify to the department both of the following:(1) The availability and expenditure of 100 percent of the nonfederal share of the cost of performing Administrative Claiming process activities. The funds expended for this purpose shall be from the local governmental agency’s general fund or the general funds of local educational agencies or from any other funds allowed under federal law and regulation.(2) In each fiscal year that its expenditures represent costs that are eligible for federal financial participation for that fiscal year.  The department shall deny the claim if it determines that the certification is not adequately supported for purposes of federal financial participation.(g) (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the state shall be held harmless, in accordance with paragraphs (2) and (3), from any federal audit disallowance and interest resulting from payments made to a participating local governmental agency or local educational consortium pursuant to this section, less the amounts already remitted to the state pursuant to subdivision (m) for the disallowed claim.(2) To the extent that a federal audit disallowance and interest results from a claim or claims for which any participating local governmental agency or local educational consortium has received reimbursement for Administrative Claiming process activities, the department shall recoup from the local governmental agency or local educational consortium that submitted the disallowed claim, through offsets or by a direct billing, amounts equal to the amount of the disallowance and interest, in that fiscal year, less the amounts already remitted to the state pursuant to subdivision (m) for the disallowed claim.  All subsequent claims submitted to the department applicable to any previously disallowed administrative activity or claim, may be held in abeyance, with no payment made, until the federal disallowance issue is resolved.(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (2), to the extent that a federal audit disallowance and interest results from a claim or claims for which the participating local governmental agency or local educational consortium has received reimbursement for Administrative Claiming process activities performed by a nongovernmental entity under contract with, and on behalf of, the participating local governmental agency or local educational consortium, the department shall be held harmless by that particular participating local governmental agency or local educational consortium for 100 percent of the amount of the federal audit disallowance and interest, less the amounts already remitted to the state pursuant to subdivision (m) for the disallowed claim.(h) The use of local matching funds required by this section shall not create, lead to, or expand the health care funding obligations or service obligations for current or future years for any participating local governmental agency or local educational consortium, except as required by this section or as may be required by federal law.(i) The department shall deny any claim from a participating local governmental agency or local educational consortium if the department determines that the claim is not adequately supported in accordance with criteria established pursuant to this subdivision and implementing regulations before it forwards the claim for reimbursement to the federal medicaid program.  In consultation with local government agencies and local educational consortia, the department shall adopt regulations that prescribe the requirements for the submission and payment of claims for administrative activities performed by each participating local governmental agency and local educational consortium.(j) Administrative activities shall be those determined by the department to be necessary for the proper and efficient administration of the state’s medicaid plan and shall be defined in regulation.(k) If the department denies any claim submitted under this section, the affected participating local governmental agency or local educational consortium may, within 30 days after receipt of written notice of the denial, request that the department reconsider its action.

Claims received and approved for payment after January 1 for dates of service in the previous fiscal year shall be included in the following year’s calculation.  Each local governmental agency’s share of the contribution for the previous fiscal year shall be determined no later than February 15 and shall be remitted to the state no later than April 1 of each year.  The contribution amount shall be paid from nonfederal, general fund revenues and shall be deposited in the Administrative Claiming Fund for transfer to the Health Care Deposit Fund.(2) Moneys received by the department pursuant to this subdivision are hereby continuously appropriated to the department for support of the Medi-Cal program, and the funds shall be administered in accordance with procedures prescribed by the Department of Finance.
