              BattinFebruary 23, 1999An act to add Section 1167.2 to the Code of Civil Procedure, relating to courts.LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 694, as introduced, Battin.
                          Unlawful detainer.Existing law provides that a tenant of real property for a term less than life who continues in possession of the property without permission, after the expiration of the term for which it is let, or after default in the payment of rent, as specified, is guilty of unlawful detainer.  A pilot project in the Los Angeles Municipal Court, and other courts, as specified, which was in effect until December 31, 1998, authorized a plaintiff in an unlawful detainer action to make a demand for a pretrial prospective rent deposit, and authorized a court to order a defendant to deposit with the court clerk 15 days’ prospective rent, calculated as specified.This bill would enact provisions similar to those enacted for purposes of the pilot project, and would make that program applicable in all counties, indefinitely, in courts that elect to implement these provisions.This bill would provide for a filing fee plus an additional sum set by the court, as specified, to be paid by a plaintiff and deposited with the county treasurer for exclusive use for the support of the program.  The bill would impose a state-mandated local program by requiring the county treasurer to maintain and account for fees available to the court only upon appropriation by the board of supervisors.However, no deposit would be required under this bill where the rented premises are subject to an outstanding citation as of the date the complaint is filed for any of specified violations.The bill would provide that a court shall have discretion to order the defendant to deposit prospective rent with the court clerk if the court finds at a pretrial hearing specified facts regarding the unlawful detainer, based on written declarations and oral testimony presented by the parties, as specified.  It would require a court to enter judgment for the plaintiff on the issue of possession of the premises and dismiss any claim for monetary relief without prejudice if the defendant fails to pay the deposit required by the court.  However, the defendant would have an opportunity to avoid entry of judgment for possession by making the prospective rent deposit 2 days from the date of the hearing.The bill would also provide that if at trial the court determines that a breach of the warranty of habitability has occurred, that was not caused by the defendant or his or her guests or invitees, sufficient to diminish the value of the premises in an amount greater that 60% of the rent, and that the defendant had notified the owner of the breach, the court shall order any prospective rent deposited pursuant to the bill returned to the defendant, and the obligation to pay specified past rent would be extinguished.The bill would also provide that any deposits made by the defendant pursuant to these provisions shall be awarded to the party entitled thereto by the trial court, and the defendant shall be given credit to the extent of the deposit against any money judgment ordered against that defendant in a subsequent action.The bill would exempt mobilehomes, manufactured homes, real property in mobilehome parks, or defined manufactured housing communities from these provisions.The bill would also require the Judicial Council to adopt specified forms for the purposes of the bill.
   The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement, including the creation of a State Mandates Claims Fund to pay the costs of mandates that do not exceed $1,000,000 statewide and other procedures for claims whose statewide costs exceed $1,000,000.This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.Digest Key

The demand shall be made in the body of the unlawful detainer complaint, on the first page thereof immediately under the case number, and on the summons issued by the court.(2) The summons and complaint shall be accompanied by a reply form.  The reply form shall be prepared by the Judicial Council to allow the defendant to advise the court and the plaintiff that the defendant denies the allegations of the unlawful detainer complaint and intends to appear and defend the action.  The information to be contained in the form shall include, but not be limited to, the following:(A) A statement that in order for the defendant to protect his or her rights, the form should be completed and returned to the court immediately, but in no event later than five days from receipt of the summons and complaint.  The form shall be returned to the court by personal delivery or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postmarked within five days from receipt of the summons and complaint.(B) A statement that, if the form is not returned to the court in the time and manner prescribed herein, the defendant shall be required to deposit with the court the prospective rent as defined in subdivision (e) by the date of the hearing in order to preserve the right to have a trial of this matter.(C) A statement that if the defendant does not return the form to the court as prescribed herein and subsequently fails to deposit the amount of prospective rent as defined in subdivision (d) up to and including the date of the hearing, the court shall order judgment for possession of the premises to be entered in favor of the plaintiff at the pretrial hearing.(3) Upon the filing of the proof of service of the summons and complaint for unlawful detainer containing a demand for a pretrial prospective rent deposit, the clerk of the court shall set a pretrial hearing date no less than eight nor more than 13 days from the filing of the proof of service, and give notice of that date to all parties by first-class mail if the plaintiff pays the fee required by Section 72055 of the Government Code, plus an additional sum in an amount set by the court to cover actual costs of the court associated with the procedure established by this section.  The proceeds from this additional fee shall be deposited with the county treasurer and, upon appropriation, be available solely to the court and the county in which the court is located and shall be used exclusively for costs associated with this procedure.  If the court provides procedures for holding a trial on the same date as the day scheduled for the pretrial hearing, the court shall use a Judicial Council form to inform defendants of the date, time, and place of the pretrial hearing.  The form shall include a statement that is substantially in the following form:“If you are represented by counsel on the date set for the pretrial hearing, the court may ask you to waive your right to the pretrial hearing and proceed directly to trial.  If you agree, the trial will begin and you will be expected to have all your evidence and witnesses present in the courtroom.  You should seriously consider whether it is in your interest to waive your right to a pretrial hearing.  If you agree to waive your right to a pretrial hearing and lose at trial, judgment will be entered against you for eviction and money damages.  Whereas, if you lose your pretrial hearing and fail to make the pretrial rent deposit within two court days, the court can only enter judgment for eviction without any money damages.”(c) (1) At the pretrial hearing, the court shall determine whether a substantial conflict exists as to a material fact or facts relevant to the unlawful detainer for purposes of requiring the defendant to deposit with the clerk of the court prospective rent as defined in subdivision (e) as a condition of continuing to trial.  If at the pretrial hearing the court determines, based upon the written declarations or oral testimony of the parties, that (A) the plaintiff is the landlord of the premises, the defendant failed to pay contract rent, the defendant was properly served with a three-day notice, and the defendant failed to tender the rent or quit the premises, and (B) no substantial conflict exists as to a material fact or facts relevant to the unlawful detainer after considering any written or oral answer to the unlawful detainer complaint made by the defendant and any and all affirmative defenses offered by the defendant, and considering any oral testimony and written declarations presented by all of the parties, then the court shall have the discretion to order the defendant to deposit, with the clerk of the court, prospective rent as defined in subdivision (e).  If the court orders a deposit of prospective rent and if the defendant fails to deposit the prospective rent within two court days from the date of the hearing, judgment for the plaintiff for possession of the premises shall be entered and a writ of possession for the premises shall be issued forthwith.  If the defendant has not returned the reply form as described in paragraph (2) of subdivision (b) in the time and manner required, any deposit of prospective rent ordered by the court shall be made by the date of the hearing.  If a defendant has not returned the reply form and then fails to deposit the prospective rent on the day of the hearing, judgment for the plaintiff for possession of the premises shall be entered and a writ of possession shall be issued forthwith.  Upon entry of judgment for possession of the premises for the plaintiff pursuant to this subdivision, the court shall dismiss any claim for money relief without prejudice.(2) For purposes of the pretrial hearing held pursuant to paragraph (1), the parties shall have the right to offer declarations, affidavits, and documentary evidence in addition to oral testimony of the parties, but no witnesses other than the parties may be called to testify.  The court shall consult the parties to ascertain whether there is a substantial conflict as to a material fact or facts relevant to the unlawful detainer.  The pretrial hearing of the case shall be informal, the object being to dispense justice promptly, fairly, and inexpensively.  Except as provided in paragraph (3), no attorney may take part in the conduct of the pretrial hearing unless the attorney is appearing to maintain an action (A) by or against himself or herself, (B) by or against a partnership in which he or she is a general partner and in which all the partners are attorneys, or (C) by a corporation.  If an attorney appears at the pretrial hearing to maintain an action as authorized by this paragraph, an attorney may appear for the opposing party in this action.(3) Notwithstanding whether the defendant has returned the reply form pursuant to paragraph (2) of subdivision (b), a defendant may respond to the summons and complaint with an oral answer at the pretrial hearing or by written answer, motion, or demurrer.  An oral answer shall be reduced to a writing by the court clerk, recorded electronically, or recorded by a court reporter.  The court, in issuing its decision, shall make findings as to the matters specified in paragraph (1) of subdivision (b), including any defenses. The decision and findings shall be reduced to a writing.  If the defendant responds to the unlawful detainer by demurrer or motion, this motion or demurrer shall be filed and served pursuant to Sections 1167 and 1167.3 and shall be heard and decided at the pretrial hearing held pursuant to this section.  Notwithstanding paragraph (2) of subdivision (c), attorneys may appear in any county for parties prosecuting or contesting a demurrer or motion.  Notwithstanding Section 1005, papers opposing the defendant’s motion or demurrer may be filed and personally served no later than one day prior to the day appointed for the hearing.  If the defendant fails to respond to the unlawful detainer by written answer, motion, demurrer, or oral answer at the pretrial hearing, the court shall order judgment for possession of the premises to be entered in favor of the plaintiff forthwith at the pretrial hearing.(4) A defendant who is represented by counsel at the pretrial hearing may be asked to stipulate to holding the trial on the date set for the pretrial hearing where the court has advised the defendant of the following in the summons:  (1) that the court may ask the defendant to stipulate to holding the trial on the same date as the pretrial hearing if the defendant is represented by counsel; (2) that he or she has the right to post a deposit and have the trial set at a later date if the court determines that a deposit is required at the pretrial hearing; (3) that if the deposit is not made, judgment for possession can only be entered against the defendant, and (4) that if trial is held, judgments for money and possession can be entered against the defendant.In no case shall the trial be held on the same date selected for the pretrial hearing unless the defendant is represented by counsel and has been given notice as provided in paragraph (4).  These provisions are nonwaivable.(d) No deposit of prospective rent as defined in this section shall be required if the defendant has paid, or deposited with the court, all rent through the month in which the action is filed.  No deposit of rent pursuant to this section shall be required if the action involves premises as to which, as of the date the complaint was filed, there was an outstanding citation issued by a state or local government agency for violations of law pertaining to health, safety, housing, building, or fire standards.(e) “Prospective rent,” for purposes of this section, means up to 15 days’ prospective rent not to exceed five hundred dollars ($500).  The prospective rent shall be calculated on a prorated basis utilizing a 30-day rental period and the lowest monthly rent charged for the premises during the prior six months of the defendant’s occupancy.  Any deposit made by the defendant pursuant to this section shall be deposited with the clerk, by cash, cashier’s check, or money order made payable to the clerk.  Receipt of the deposit shall be acknowledged in writing and deposited and retained by the clerk pursuant to Section 24353 of the Government Code until further order of the court.  The receipt and amount of a deposit of prospective rent shall be included in the order of the court at the conclusion of the pretrial hearing.(f) If at trial the court determines that a breach of the warranty of habitability has occurred, that the defendant, or his or her guests or invitees did not cause the breach of this warranty, that the breach of this warranty is sufficient to diminish the value of the premises in an amount greater than 60 percent of the contract rent, and that the defendant had given the owner notice to repair or eliminate the breach, the court shall order the entire amount of prospective rent deposited by the defendant pursuant to this section returned to the defendant.  In this case, the obligation of payment of past rent for the period covered by the eviction notice shall be extinguished.  In order to remain in the premises, the defendant shall pay the reduced rent from the time of trial until the defect is cured.  The rights and remedies in this paragraph are in addition to any other rights and remedies relating to the habitability of dwelling units.(g) Notwithstanding paragraph (1) of subdivision (c), any deposit made by the defendant pursuant to this section shall be awarded to the party entitled thereto by the trial court.  The defendant shall be given credit to the extent of the deposit against any money judgment ordered against the defendant in a subsequent action.(h) This section does not apply to actions for possession of a mobilehome or manufactured home, as those terms are defined in subdivision (a) of Section 1161a, and does not apply to actions for possession of real property in a mobilehome park subject to the Mobilehome Residency Law (Chapter 2.5 (commencing with Section 798) of Title 2 of Part 2 of Division 2 of the Civil Code), or to a manufactured housing community, as defined in Section 18801 of the Health and Safety Code.(i) Section 473 shall apply to this section.SEC. 2. Notwithstanding Section 17610 of the Government Code, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.  If the statewide cost of the claim for reimbursement does not exceed one million dollars ($1,000,000), reimbursement shall be made from the State Mandates Claims Fund.
