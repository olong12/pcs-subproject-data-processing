                LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 703, Lempert.
                          Ballast water.Existing law requires the Department of Fish and Game to adopt the International Maritime Organization’s “Guidelines for Preventing the Introduction of Unwanted Aquatic Organisms and Pathogens from Ships’ Ballast Water and Sediment Discharges” as the policy of the state to prevent the introduction and spread of aquatic nuisance species into any river, estuary, bay, or coastal area through the exchange of ballast water of vessels prior to entering those waters and to adopt a ballast water control report form to monitor compliance with those guidelines.This bill, with certain exceptions, would require the master, operator, or person in charge of a vessel to employ prescribed ballast water management practices for ballast water carried into the waters of the state from areas outside the exclusive economic zone, as defined.  The bill would require those persons to take certain actions to minimize the uptake and release of nonindigenous species.  The bill would require the master, owner, operator, agent, or person in charge of a vessel carrying ballast water into waters of the state after operating outside the exclusive economic zone to provide the State Lands Commission, and maintain on board the vessel, specified information.The bill would require the State Lands Commission to take samples of ballast water and sediment and to take other action to assess the compliance of any vessel with prescribed requirements.  The bill would prohibit, unless required by federal law, any state agency from imposing requirements different from those contained in the bill relating to the discharge of ballast water for the purpose of limiting the introduction of nonindigenous species prior to January 1, 2004.  The bill would, on or before December 1, 2002, require the State Water Resources Control Board to evaluate alternatives for managing ballast water, as specified.  The bill would require the Department of Fish and Game to conduct a study relating to resident nonindigenous species populations, as prescribed.  The bill would, on or before September 1, 2002, require the State Lands Commission to submit to the Legislature, and make available to the public, a report relating to ballast water.  The bill would require the state board, the State Lands Commission, and the Department of Fish and Game to conduct prescribed research.The bill would subject a person who fails to comply with the ballast water management program required to be undertaken by the bill with prescribed civil penalties.  The bill would require the State Lands Commission to establish fees not to exceed $1,000 per vessel, as specified.  The bill would require the money generated by the imposition of the fees and the penalties to be deposited in the Exotic Species Control Fund, which the bill would create. The money in the fund, upon appropriation by the Legislature, would be available to carry out the ballast water management program, as described above.The provisions of this bill would be repealed on January 1, 2004.Digest KeyBill TextThe people of the State of California do enact as follows:SECTION 1. Division 36 (commencing with Section 71200) is added to the Public Resources Code, to read:DIVISION 36. BALLAST WATER MANAGEMENT FOR CONTROL OF NONINDIGENOUS SPECIES
                CHAPTER
               1. General Provisions71200. Unless the context otherwise requires, the following definitions govern the construction of this division:(a) “Ballast tank” means any tank or hold on a vessel used for carrying ballast water, whether or not the tank or hold was designed for that purpose.(b) “Ballast water” means any water and suspended matter taken on board a vessel to control or maintain trim, draft, stability, or stresses of the vessel, without regard to the manner in which it is carried.(c) “EEZ” means exclusive economic zone, which extends from the baseline of the territorial sea of the United States seaward 200 miles.(d) “Exchange” means to replace the water in a ballast tank using either of the following methods:(1) “Flow through exchange,” means to flush out ballast water by pumping in mid-ocean water at the bottom of the tank and continuously overflowing the tank from the top until three full volumes of water have been changed to minimize the number of original organisms remaining in the tank.(2) “Empty/refill exchange,” means to pump out, until the tank is empty or as close to 100 percent as the master or operator determines is safe to do so, the ballast water taken on in ports, or estuarine or territorial waters, then refilling the tank with mid-ocean waters.(e) “Mid-ocean waters” means waters that are more than 200 nautical miles from land and at least 2,000 meters (6,560 feet, 1,093 fathoms) deep.(f) “Nonindigenous species” means any species or other viable biological material that enters an ecosystem beyond its historic range, including any such organism transferred from one country into another.(g) “Person” means any individual, trust, firm, joint stock company, or corporation, including, but not limited to, a government corporation, partnership, or association.(h) “Sediments” means any matter settled out of ballast water within a vessel.(i) “Waters of the state” means any surface waters, including saline waters, that are within the boundaries of the state.(j) “Voyage” means any transit by a vessel destined for any California port from a port or place outside the EEZ, including intermediate stops at a port or place within the EEZ.  For the purposes of this division, a transit by a vessel from a United States port to any other United States port, if at any time the vessel operates outside the EEZ or equivalent zone of Canada, is also a voyage.71201. (a) This division applies to all vessels, United States and foreign, carrying ballast water into the waters of the state after operating outside the EEZ, except those vessels described in Section 71202.(b) This division applies to all ballast water and associated sediments taken on a vessel in areas less than 200 nautical miles from any shore, or with water that is less than 2,000 meters (6,560 feet, 1,093 fathoms) deep.71201.5. This division does not authorize the discharge of oil or noxious liquid substances in a manner prohibited by state, federal or international laws or regulations.  Ballast water carried in any tank containing a residue of oil, noxious liquid substances, or any other pollutant shall be discharged in accordance with the applicable requirements.71202. This division does not apply to any of the following vessels:(a) A crude oil tanker engaged in the coastwise trade, as implemented by the United States Coast Guard in accordance with the National Invasive Species Act of 1996.(b) A passenger vessel equipped with a functioning treatment system designed to kill nonindigenous species in the ballast water if both of the following apply:(1) The State Lands Commission has determined that the system is at least as effective as ballast water exchange at reducing the risk of transfer of nonindigenous species in the ballast water of passenger vessels.(2) The master, operator, or person in charge of the vessel operates, or ensures the operation of, the treatment system as designed.(c) A vessel of the United States Department of Defense or United States Coast Guard subject to the requirements of Section 1103 of the National Invasive Species Act of 1996, or any vessel of the armed forces, as defined in Section 1322(a)(14) of Title 33 of the United States Code that is subject to the “Uniform National Discharge Standards for Vessels of the Armed Forces” pursuant to Section 1322(n) of Title 33 of the United States Code.(d) A vessel that discharges ballast water or sediments only at the location where the ballast water or sediments originated, if the ballast water or sediments do not mix with ballast water or sediments from areas other than mid-ocean waters.(e) A vessel in innocent passage, which is a foreign vessel merely traversing the territorial sea of the United States and not entering or departing a United States port, or not navigating the internal waters of the United States.  However, it is the intent of the Legislature that a vessel described in this subdivision does not discharge ballast water into the waters of the state, or into waters that may impact waters of the state, unless the vessel meets the requirements of Section 71204.
