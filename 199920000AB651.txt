                          Telecommunications:  access:  private property:  agreements prohibited payments.(1) Under existing law, the Public Utilities Commission has regulatory authority over public utilities, including telephone corporations and other specified entities.  The Public Utilities Act authorizes certain public utilities to condemn property, as prescribed.This bill would, under the Public Utilities Act, prohibit a telecommunications provider, as defined, from providing payment to obtain access to a building in order to provide telecommunications service, as defined, to a tenant that has requested the services.  The bill would specify exceptions to that prohibition. state that the commission may exercise specified authority to the extent, and in the manner, that it determines to be appropriate, and would require the commission to exercise its authority with regard to access to buildings by a public utility in a specified manner.  The bill, except as specified, would prohibit a building owner, as defined, from demanding or accepting payment in any form, and a telecommunications provider, as defined, from offering or making payment in any form, in exchange for permitting a telecommunications provider access to tenants or occupants of an occupied building or the property or premises upon which an occupied building is sited.  The bill would require a building owner to allow wiring, facilities, and related equipment to provide telecommunications service by a telecommunications provider, if specified requirements are met, as prescribed.  The bill would authorize a telecommunications provider to file a formal complaint with the commission against any other telecommunications provider or building owner that is party to an agreement, alleging that the agreement has the effect of restricting the access of telecommunications providers to an occupied building, as prescribed, and would require the commission to impose certain fines if it makes a specified finding.  The bill would require the commission to adopt specified regulations authorizing telecommunications providers to reasonably compensate a building owner for any use or occupation of property associated with the installation of wiring and ancillary facilities for the provision of telecommunications service, in accordance with prescribed compensation standards.  The bill would require any person, firm, or corporation that the commission determines has failed to comply with specified provisions to pay a civil penalty of $1,000 for each day following the issuance of a final order by the commission.  Because a violation of the act is a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program by creating new crimes.
   (2) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.Digest Key

If a building owner declares that there is  inadequate space in a telephone closet or designated area for additional telecommunications equipment the building owner shall permit a requesting telecommunications provider to inspect the occupied building to verify that declaration and to inspect for additional space for the placement of equipment.  That inspection shall be by the employment of an independent third party.

If an independent inspection verifies the declaration by the building owner that there is inadequate space in the telephone closet or designated area, the requesting telecommunications provider shall bear the costs of the independent inspection.

The complainant shall have the burden of proving one of the following:(A)The defendant telecommunications provider is the exclusive provider of service to the occupied building.(B)The defendant telecommunications provider is the beneficiary of more favorable terms of access granted by the building owner in violation of paragraph (1).(C)The building owner is discriminating among telecommunications providers in violation of subdivision (c).(3)If, after a hearing, the commission finds that a telecommunications provider’s agreement or arrangement with a building owner violates paragraph (1), the commission shall require the renegotiation of the agreement or arrangement within 60 days from the date of that finding.  If the agreement or arrangement is not renegotiated within 60 days of the finding by the commission, the commission shall impose on the parties to the agreement or arrangement a fine of not less than five hundred dollars ($500), and not to exceed two thousand dollars ($2,000), per day, based on the number of lines served in the building, until the agreement or arrangement is renegotiated.(h)(1)If a telecommunications provider requires space for equipment and related facilities outside of the telecommunications space normally provided by the building owner, then, consistent with subdivision (f), the telecommunications provider shall compensate the building owner at the cost for space not normally occupied by tenants, and at market value for space normally occupied by building tenants.  As used in this section “space not normally occupied by building tenants” is space for which the building owner does not receive revenue from nonutility providers.  If the telecommunications provider requires space that encroaches on regularly used tenant common areas, including, but not limited to, hallways, foyers, or entryways, the telecommunications provider shall pay a market-based rental rate for the use of that space.  The commission shall deem the compensation standards described in this paragraph to be just, reasonable, and appropriate compensation due the building owner.(2)The commission shall adopt regulations authorizing telecommunications providers to reasonably compensate a building owner for any use or occupation of property associated with the installation of wiring and ancillary facilities for the provision of telecommunications service in accordance with this section.  The regulations shall include, but not be limited to, an expedited dispute resolution process.(3)Nothing in this subdivision shall be construed as giving the building owner the right to charge any monthly recurring fee for access to an occupied building.(i)Nothing in this section precludes a telecommunications provider from installing telecommunications equipment or facilities in an occupied building prior to the commission’s determination of the compensation due the building owner.(j)Except as provided by this article, and excluding any provider of shared tenant services that are regulated by the commission pursuant to commission Decision 87-01-063, as modified by the commission Decision 87-05-009, any building owner who seeks to receive, or receives, revenue from the use of inside telecommunications wiring or the placement of telecommunications facilities and equipment within his or her building shall be considered a telecommunications provider subject to regulation by the commission pursuant to Sections 216, 234, and 1013.  That building owner shall provide service to the building’s tenants in a manner that is nondiscriminatory to any tenant or telecommunications provider, and in compliance with all commission rules applicable to telecommunications providers, including collection and payment of all surcharges.  An agreement authorized by subdivision (f) or (h), and any commission received for the nonexclusive referral of tenants to a telecommunications service provider shall not make a building owner subject to regulation under this subdivision.(k)Any person, firm, or corporation that the commission determines, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, has failed to comply with subdivisions (c) to (j), inclusive, shall pay to the state a civil penalty of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000) for each day following the date of the issuance of a final order by the commission that the person, firm, or corporation fails to comply with any of those provisions.(l)Nothing in this section prohibits a telecommunications provider from maintaining or entering into an exclusive advertising or sponsorship relationship with a tenant, user, or owner of a multipurpose sports facility or a multipurpose sports and entertainment facility, which may have the collateral effect of limiting the rights of a telecommunications provider to provide service to the facility specified in the exclusive advertising or sponsorship relationship.
