                LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 695, Mazzoni.
                          School facilities:  construction and modernization.Existing law, the Leroy F. Greene School Facilities Act of 1998, (the Greene Act of 1998) establishes a program in which the State Allocation Board is required to provide state per-pupil funding, including hardship funding, for new school facilities construction and school facilities modernization to applicant school districts, as defined, and requires applicants to provide local matching funds.This bill would authorize the board to adopt or amend regulations on or after January 1, 2000, to adjust the assumed capacity for each teaching station used for nonsevere or severe special day class purposes after considering the recommendations of the Legislative Analyst required pursuant to existing law, which would be implemented upon approval of the Director of Finance. This bill would authorize the board to adopt, on or after January 1, 2001, regulations establishing assumed capacity standards, after consideration of recommendations developed by the Director of Finance, for continuation high school, community day school, county community school, and county community day school, teaching stations.  This bill would require adjustments pursuant to these regulations, or any other adjustments to the existing capacity related to changes in the assumed capacity of these teaching stations to be approved by the Director of Finance prior to implementation.Existing law permits funding under the Greene Act of 1998 for projects approved pursuant to the state school facilities funding provisions operative prior to November 4, 1998, if certain conditions are met.This bill would require the board to adopt regulations to offset funding provided under the previous school facilities funding provisions from grants under the Greene Act of 1998.The Greene Act of 1998 requires school districts to make all necessary repairs, renewals, and replacements, to ensure that a project is at all times kept in good repair, working order, and condition, and requires that all costs incurred for this purpose be borne by the school district.  Existing law requires the applicant school district to establish a restricted account for providing moneys for ongoing and major repair of the facilities, and to agree to annually deposit at least 3% of the school district’s general fund budget for a period of 20 years.This bill would require the 3% maintenance requirement to be calculated, for the purposes of a county office of education, based upon the county office of education general fund less any restricted accounts.  Existing law relating to the formation of school facilities improvement district, authorizes the governing board of the school district to provide for and call a special bond election within the school facilities improvement district to submit to the voters a proposition on whether to incur debt and issue bonds, and prohibits elections from being held within 45 days before or after a statewide election, unless conducted at the statewide election.This bill would repeal provisions prohibiting an election within the 45-day period before or after a statewide election, and would permit the election to be called for any date, except as specified.Existing law provides specific dates on which elections are required to be held, but exempts certain elections from those requirements, including but not limited to, elections relating to school bonds.This bill would specifically exempt from those provisions elections relating to school facility improvement districts.Existing law requires the calculation of existing pupil capacity to be made on a one-time basis as a baseline for eligibility determinations, and requires each participating school district to submit to the board a one-time report of existing school building capacity.This bill would, notwithstanding those provisions, require a school district newly formed reorganized, or affected by reorganization pursuant to an election that occurred on or after November 4, 1998, to calculate its existing school building capacity pursuant to regulations adopted by the State Allocation Board.Existing law sets forth the manner in which the board shall determine each applicant school district’s maximum total new construction per-pupil grant eligibility.This bill would, until January 1, 2003, authorize the board to approve a new construction supplemental apportionment not to exceed $7,500, and a modernization supplemental apportionment not to exceed $2,500, for a school having an enrollment of 2,500 or less for the prior fiscal year.  The bill would require the board to adjust these amounts in 2000 and every 2 years thereafter.Existing law, the Class Size Reduction Kindergarten-University Public Education Facilities Bond Act of 1998, (the School Bond Act of 1998) authorizes the issuance and sale of bonds and the use of the revenues, in part, for the purposes of the Greene Act of 1998.The School Bond Act of 1998 authorizes not less than $700,000,000 to be allocated, commencing with the 1998–99 fiscal year, to assist school districts with site acquisition and facilities-related costs of kindergarten and grades 1 to 3, inclusive, that are participating in a class size reduction program pursuant to prescribed provisions of law.Existing law requires funds not expended pursuant to these provisions to be allocated to school districts that request prescribed funding for teaching stations that were displaced.This bill would, instead, authorize that the unexpended funds be allocated in this manner.Existing law authorizes the governing board of a school district to impose an amount calculated pursuant to a prescribed formula in lieu of amounts that may be imposed upon residential construction pursuant to prescribed provisions of law, and with certain exceptions, requires that these amounts be expended solely on school facilities identified as being attributable to projected growth from the construction of new residential units.  Existing law limits site development costs for these purposes to 2 times the amount funded by the State Allocation Board.This bill would recast those provisions and would make this limitation applicable to expenditure of fees assessed pursuant to provisions permitting increased fees when state funds for new school construction are not available. The bill would limit site development costs for these purposes to the estimated amount that would be funded by the State Allocation Board pursuant to its regulations.Existing law requires the governing board of a school district to conduct a facility needs analysis for this purpose, and permits its revision at any time.This bill would require recalculation of the school building capacity for those purposes as part of any revision of the needs analysis.Digest KeyBill TextThe people of the State of California do enact as follows:SECTION 1. Section 15340 of the Education Code is amended to read:15340. (a) After adopting the resolution ordering the formation of the school facilities improvement district, the governing board may provide for and call a special bond election within the school facilities improvement district to, or may at the next statewide election, submit to the voters of the school facilities improvement district a proposition of whether or not an indebtedness of the district shall be incurred and bonds issued therefor in an amount not exceeding the estimate stated in the resolution ordering the school facilities improvement district formed.

The amount of the supplemental apportionment shall be adjusted in 2001 and every year thereafter by an amount equal to the percentage adjustment for class B construction.  This subdivision shall be operative only until January 1, 2003.SEC. 13. Section 17076.10 of the Education Code is amended to read:17076.10. (a) A school district that has received any funds pursuant to this chapter shall submit a summary report of expenditure of state funds and of district matching funds annually until all state funds and district matching funds are expended, and shall then submit a final report to the board.  The board may require an audit of these reports or other district records to ensure that all funds received pursuant to this chapter are expended in accordance with program requirements.(b) If the board finds that a participating school district has made no substantial progress towards increasing its pupil capacity or renovating its facilities within 18 months of the receipt of any funding pursuant to this chapter, the board shall rescind the apportionment in an amount equal to the unexpended funds.(c) If the board, after the review of expenditures or audit has been conducted pursuant to subdivision (a), determines that a school district failed to expend funds in accordance with this chapter, the department shall notify the school district of the amount that must be repaid to the 1998 State School Facilities Fund within 60 days.  If the school district fails to make the required payment within 60 days, the department shall notify the Controller and the school district in writing, and the Controller shall deduct an amount equal to the amount received by the school district under this subdivision, from the school district’s next principal apportionment or apportionments of state funds to the school district, other than basic aid apportionments required by Section 6 of Article IX of the California Constitution.  Any amounts obtained by the Controller shall be deposited into the 1998 State School Facilities Fund.(d) If a school district has received an apportionment, but has not met the criteria to have funds released pursuant to Section 17072.32 or 17074.15 within a period established by the board, but not to exceed 18 months, the board shall rescind the apportionment and deny the district’s application.SEC. 14. Section 100420 of the Education Code is amended to read:100420. (a) Of the proceeds from the sale of bonds, issued and sold pursuant to this chapter, as specified in subdivision (a) of Section 100410, not more than three billion three hundred fifty million dollars ($3,350,000,000) shall be allocated beginning in the 1998–99 fiscal year in accordance with the following schedule:(1) Not less than one billion three hundred fifty million dollars ($1,350,000,000) for project funding related to the growth in enrollment of applicant school districts under Chapter 12 and Chapter 12.5 that have incurred or will incur enrollment increases.(2) Not less than eight hundred million dollars ($800,000,000) for the reconstruction or modernization of facilities pursuant to Chapter 12 and Chapter 12.5.(3) Not more than five hundred million dollars ($500,000,000) shall be deposited in the Public School Critical Hardship Account, which is hereby established in the 1998 State School Facilities Fund and shall be allocated by the State Allocation Board to fund critical hardships as defined in Chapter 12.5.

On and after July 1, 2000, if applications for the total funds available under this paragraph have not been filed with the State Allocation Board, the funds for which applications have not been received may be allocated by the board to other high priority needs as the board determines.  On and after July 1, 2003, any funds not allocated are available for other high priority needs.(B) The funds allocated in subparagraph (A) shall be allocated to the State Department of Education to provide class size reduction facilities grants necessary to implement the K–3 Class Size Reduction Program established pursuant to Chapter 6.10 (commencing with Section 52120) of Part 28 and Chapter 19 (commencing with Section 17200) of Part 10.  The department shall certify to the State Allocation Board the amount of funds needed for this purpose.  The board shall transfer the amount of funds needed to the department.

The school facilities needs analysis shall project the number of unhoused elementary, middle, and high school pupils generated by new residential units, in each category of pupils enrolled in the district.  This projection of unhoused pupils shall be based on the historical student generation rates of new residential units constructed during the previous five years that are of a similar type of unit to those anticipated to be constructed either in the school district or the city or county in which the school district is located, and relevant planning agency information, such as multiphased development projects, that may modify the historical figures.  For purposes of this paragraph, “type” means a single family detached, single family attached, or multifamily unit.  The existing school building capacity shall be calculated pursuant to Article 2 (commencing with Section 17071.10) of Chapter 12.5 of Part 10 of the Education Code.

If a district meets the requirements of paragraph (3) of subdivision (b) of Section 65995.5 by having a substantial enrollment on a multitrack year-round schedule, the determination of whether the district has school building capacity area shall reflect the additional capacity created by the multitrack year-round schedule.(b) When determining the funds necessary to meet its facility needs, the governing board shall do each of the following:(1) Identify and consider any surplus property owned by the district that can be used as a schoolsite or that is available for sale to finance school facilities.(2) Identify and consider the extent to which projected enrollment growth may be accommodated by excess capacity in existing facilities.(3) Identify and consider local sources other than fees, charges, dedications, or other requirements imposed on residential construction available to finance the construction or reconstruction of school facilities needed to accommodate any growth in enrollment attributable to the construction of new residential units.(c) The governing board shall adopt the school facility needs analysis by resolution at a public hearing.  The school facilities needs analysis may not be adopted until the school facilities needs analysis in its final form has been made available to the public for a period of not less than 30 days during which time the school facilities needs analysis shall be provided to the local agency responsible for land use planning for its review and comment. Prior to the adoption of the school facilities needs analysis, the public shall have the opportunity to review and comment on the school facilities needs analysis and the governing board shall respond to written comments it receives regarding the school facilities needs analysis.(d) Notice of the time and place of the hearing, including the location and procedure for viewing or requesting a copy of the proposed school facilities needs analysis and any proposed revision of the school facilities needs analysis, shall be published in at least one newspaper of general circulation within the jurisdiction of the school district that is conducting the hearing no less than 30 days prior to the hearing.  If there is no paper of general circulation, the notice shall be posted in at least three conspicuous public places within the jurisdiction of the school district not less than 30 days prior to the hearing.  In addition to these notice requirements, the governing board shall mail a copy of the school facilities needs analysis and any proposed revision to the school facilities needs analysis not less than 30 days prior to the hearing to any person who has made a written request if the written request was made 45 days prior to the hearing.  The governing board may charge a fee reasonably related to the cost of providing these materials to those persons who request the school facilities needs analysis or revision.(e) The school facilities needs analysis may be revised at any time in the same manner, and the revision is subject to the same conditions and requirements, applicable to the adoption of the school facilities needs analysis.(f) A fee, charge, dedication, or other requirement in an amount authorized by this section or Section 65995.7, shall be adopted by a resolution of the governing board as part of the adoption or revision of the school facilities needs analysis and may not be effective for more than one year.  Notwithstanding subdivision (a) of Section 17621 of the Education Code, or any other provision of law, the fee, charge, dedication, or other requirement authorized by the resolution shall take effect immediately after the adoption of the resolution.(g) Division 13 (commencing with Section 21000) of the Public Resources Code may not apply to the preparation, adoption, or update of the school facilities needs analysis, or adoption of the resolution specified in this section.(h) Notice and hearing requirements other than those provided in this section may not be applicable to the adoption or revision of a school facilities needs analysis or the resolutions adopted pursuant to this section.SEC. 18. The Legislature finds and declares that the modifications to the Class Size Reduction Kindergarten-University Public Education Facilities Bond Act of 1998 made by this act further the purposes of, and are consistent with, that act.
