              StricklandFebruary 23, 1999An act to add Section 60649 to Chapter 3.51 (commencing with Section 44765) to Part 25 of the Education Code, relating to teachers.LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 657, as amended, Strickland.
                          Teachers:  pupil testing:  stipend.Existing law establishes the Standardized Testing and Reporting Program, under which achievement tests are administered to pupils in grades 2 to 11, inclusive.  Existing law, the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards Certification Incentive Program, awards grants to school districts for the purpose of providing one-time $10,000 merit awards to teachers who are employed by school districts or charter schools, are assigned to teach in California public schools, and have attained certification from the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards.This bill would establish the Classroom Teacher Excellence Recognition Pilot Program, whereby up to 8 school districts would be selected to participate in the program.  The program would provide for annual awards in a maximum amount of $10,000 annually to selected employees, subject to funds being appropriated therefor.  The bill would require the Legislative Analyst to contract for a neutral evaluator to evaluate the program’s effectiveness.This bill would provide that the Classroom Teacher Excellence Recognition Pilot Program is repealed on December 1, 2005.This bill would, subject to an appropriation being made for that purpose, require the governing board of a school district to award a one-time stipend to each teacher who provides direct instruction to pupils enrolled in grades 1 to 6, inclusive, in subjects tested by the achievement test administered under the Standardized Testing and Reporting Program if the pupils assigned to his or her classroom perform, on the average, greater than one grade level beyond their scores at the prior administration of the test.  The bill would require the amount of the stipend to be $1,000 for each grade level that the pupils, on average, progress beyond their scores at the prior administration of the test.  By requiring the governing board of a school district to award these stipends, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
   The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state.  Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement, including the creation of a State Mandates Claims Fund to pay the costs of mandates that do not exceed $1,000,000 statewide and other procedures for claims whose statewide costs exceed $1,000,000.This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.Digest Key
