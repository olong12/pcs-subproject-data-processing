              CardenasFebruary 24, 1999An act to amend Section 14212 of the Elections Code, relating to elections.LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 709, Cardenas.
                          Elections: polling place hours.Existing law provides that on the day of an election, the polls shall be kept open until 8 p.m., except as specified.This bill would revise the closing time to 9 p.m., except as specified.  By increasing the duties of local elections officials, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
   The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement, including the creation of a State Mandates Claims Fund to pay the costs of mandates that do not exceed $1,000,000 statewide and other procedures for claims whose statewide costs exceed $1,000,000.This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.Digest KeyBill TextThe people of the State of California do enact as follows:SECTION 1. Section 14212 of the Elections Code is amended to read:14212. The polls shall be open at 7 a.m. of the day of any election, and shall be kept open until 9 p.m. of the same day, when the polls shall be closed, except as provided in Section 14401.SEC. 2. Notwithstanding Section 17610 of the Government Code, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.  If the statewide cost of the claim for reimbursement does not exceed one million dollars ($1,000,000), reimbursement shall be made from the State Mandates Claims Fund.
