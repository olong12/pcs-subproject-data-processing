                          Low-income electric and gas customers Electrical restructuring:  programs:  funding.(1) The Public Utilities Act requires specified electrical corporations to allow customers to make voluntary contributions through their utility bill payments as either a fixed amount or a variable amount to support programs established for the in-state operation and development of existing and new and emerging renewable resource technologies, as described.  The act requires the Public Utilities Commission to order certain electrical corporations to collect and spend funds for, among other purposes, cost-effective energy efficiency and conservation activities, in accordance with a prescribed schedule.This bill would require those specified electrical corporations to also allow customers to make those voluntary contributions described above to support programs established for cost-effective energy efficiency and conservation activities.  The bill would require the commission to allocate the funds collected to support those programs in accordance with administration and expenditure criteria, upon the establishment of those criteria by the Legislature.  The bill would require the commission to order certain electrical corporations, on and after January 1, 2002, to collect a specified fee to support cost-effective energy efficiency and conservation activities.  Because a violation of the act or an order of the commission is a crime, this bill would impose state-mandated local programs by creating new crimes.(2) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.(1)Existing law requires the Public Utilities Commission to establish a program of assistance to low-income electric and gas customers, which is referred to as the California Alternate Rates for Energy or CARE program.This bill would require the electric and gas corporations that participate in the CARE program to administer low-income energy efficiency and rate assistance programs as described.  The bill would require the administrators of the program to undertake certain functions and would allow the commission to require these participating corporations to competitively bid, to the extent practical, service delivery components of these programs.  The bill would require the bidding criteria to recognize specified factors, subject to commission modification.  The bill would make conforming changes.(2)Existing law requires the commission to require an electric or gas corporation to perform home weatherization services, as defined, for low-income customers, as determined by the commission.This bill would revise the definition of “weatherization.”Digest Key
