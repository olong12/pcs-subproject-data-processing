              Runner, Strickland)February 23, 1999An act to amend Section 1797.84 of, and to add Section 1797.219 to, the Health and Safety Code, relating to emergency medical services.LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTAB 678, Dutra.
                          Emergency medical services:  immunization and screening programs.Existing law permits any local emergency medical services agency to authorize an advanced life support or limited advanced life support program that provides services utilizing paramedics for the delivery of emergency medical care to the sick and injured at the scene of an emergency, during transport to a general acute care hospital, during interfacility transfer, while in the emergency department of a general acute care hospital until care responsibility is assumed by the regular staff of that hospital, and during training within the facilities of a participating general acute care hospital.This bill would authorize the Alameda County EMS agency to establish a disease immunization program, overseen by the  director of the county health department, that provides immunization services utilizing EMT-Ps trained, as provided under the bill, in the administration of disease immunizations.  The bill would also declare the intent of the Legislature to test the concept of outreach programs in disease-preventable immunization programs in geographic regions of the state pursuant to pilot projects, and to authorize the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development to approve no more than 3 immunization pilot projects for this purpose.Digest KeyBill TextThe people of the State of California do enact as follows:SECTION 1. Section 1797.84 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to read:1797.84. “Emergency Medical Technician-Paramedic,” “EMT-P,” “paramedic,” or “mobile intensive care paramedic” means an individual whose scope of practice to provide advanced life support, including the authority to administer certain immunizations as prescribed in subdivision (a) of Section 1797.219, is according to standards prescribed by this division and who has a valid certificate issued pursuant to this division.SEC. 2. Section 1797.219 is added to the Health and Safety Code, to read:1797.219. (a) (1) The Alameda County EMS agency may authorize a disease immunization program, overseen by the director of the county health department, that provides immunization services utilizing EMT-Ps trained in the administration of childhood disease immunizations.(2) The program authorized by this subdivision utilizing EMT-Ps shall be a part of an overall communitywide immunization program.  The overall communitywide immunization program shall include the coordinated efforts of fire departments, school districts, and practicing physicians.(3) Participation of at least one registered nurse experienced in immunization practices shall be required at any site where an authorized disease immunization program is conducted pursuant to this subdivision.(b) To be certified to administer immunizations pursuant to this section, the EMT-P shall satisfy each of the following requirements:(1) Satisfactorily complete a training program for immunizations that shall meet or exceed the Teaching Immunization Practices (TIP) curriculum and that shall include supervised field experience in immunization practice and recordkeeping, including, but not limited to, experience in the administration of disease-preventable vaccines, comprehensive treatment documentation, and other protocols established by the county EMS agency.(2) Annually, satisfactorily complete a continuing education program in immunization administration.(c) The participation by EMT-Ps in the immunization program authorized under this section is not mandatory.(d) Notwithstanding the decision of the Alameda County EMS agency to authorize an immunization program pursuant to this section, it is the intent of the Legislature as follows:(1) The concept set forth in this section shall be tested in geographic regions of the state pursuant to pilot projects.  The Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development may approve no more than three additional immunization pilot projects to test the concept of outreach programs utilizing EMT-Ps.  Each pilot project shall last no longer than one year.(2) EMS agencies interested in participating in a pilot project to test the concept of outreach programs in disease-preventable immunization programs utilizing EMT-Ps may successfully complete a pilot program conducted under the auspices of the Health Manpower Pilot Project Program of the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development.(3) In addition to the evaluation criteria outlined in Section 128165, the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development shall determine whether an immunization pilot program utilizing EMT-Ps has resulted in the layoff on one or more public health nurses or the closure of any public health clinic or any county health department facility.  If the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development determines that an immunization pilot program utilizing EMT-Ps has resulted in the layoff of one or more public health nurses or the closure of any public health clinic or any county health department facility, that program shall no longer be authorized to continue.(4) Immunization pilot projects shall be closely coordinated with local health jurisdictions, and shall adhere to procedures and protocols of local immunization programs.  Local health jurisdictions shall review the protocol for vaccine administration, recordkeeping and tracking, and provide for vaccine distribution.  Programs shall be linked with immunization registries where they have been implemented.SEC. 3. Due to the unique circumstances concerning the County for Alameda, the Legislature finds and declares that a general statute cannot be made applicable within the meaning of Section 16 of Article IV of the Constitution.
